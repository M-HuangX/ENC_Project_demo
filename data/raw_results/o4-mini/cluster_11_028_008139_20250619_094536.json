He wears a long blue robe with red cloak, haloed in burnished gold. His hair and beard are stroked with fine lines. Above him, God the Father emerges from a gilt cloud, holding an open scroll inscribed with text. The interior field is dark blue with repeating gold lozenges. The initial’s frame is rich red with green infill. Surrounding text in black ink and red rubrics fills the page; the large initial interrupts the line. The decorative margins feature tall foliate stems sprouting acanthus leaves in blue, pink and green, with punched gold dots. In the lower margin, swirling foliate grotesques echo colors of the main scene. The composition centers on the divine-human encounter, with David’s gesture and gaze leading the viewer upward to the scroll-bearing deity. The lavish border and initial unify text and image, guiding devotional focus."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This leaf, likely from a mid-14th-century French psalter, exemplifies the courtly aesthetic and devotional emphasis of its time. Crafted on high-quality calf vellum with a professional Gothic textura hand, the page bears hallmarks of a luxury workshop, perhaps associated with Parisian illuminators serving aristocratic patrons. The historiated initial portraying David receiving the divine word reflects a theological program linking royal authority to divine inspiration, underscored by the burnished gold and ultramarine pigments reserved for sacred figures. The inventive use of layered washes and white highlighting in drapery achieves a subtle naturalism uncommon in earlier manuscripts, suggesting an awareness of panel painting techniques. The extensive foliate borders with acanthus scrolls and grotesque forms demonstrate the integration of secular ornamental motifs into sacred contexts, reflecting the growing taste for visual spectacle in private devotion. Iconographically, the scroll held by God underscores the power of the psalm text itself, inviting the reader to enter into David’s act of worship. Comparatively, this page shares stylistic affinities with the Psalter of Jeanne of Évreux, particularly in its refined line work and border innovation. It represents a moment of transition toward more personalized liturgical books, combining tradition and novelty to serve both spiritual and social functions."

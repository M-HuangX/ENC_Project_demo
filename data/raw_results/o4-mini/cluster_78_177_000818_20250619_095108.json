Christ wears a dark blue tunic edged in white with a vermillion robe; his halo is gold with white line highlights. Peter, in green and red robes, raises his right hand to his head in surprise. Behind Peter stand seven other apostles in varied robes of blue, green and red, each with gold halos, their hands raised in gestures of amazement or deference. A folded red drapery hangs at upper left, indicating an interior space. The basin is a shallow white bowl on a pedestal with visible rim pattern. All figures rest on a single blue bench; their bare feet project beyond the roundel edge. The ground plane is indicated by a narrow blue band at the bottom of the circle. Figures overlap to suggest depth, with those at rear partially obscured. Costumes display simple weave patterns and gold trim at hems. The compositional focus is the contact point of water, foot, and hand of Christ, emphasized by converging gazes and gestures."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This double medallion illumination, likely produced in a northern French workshop circa 1230–1240, reflects the heightened emphasis on Holy Week devotion in the decades following the Fourth Lateran Council (1215). The crisp line work, burnished gold backgrounds and sophisticated punchwork suggest a high-status commission, perhaps for a member of the Capetian court. The sequential pairing of the Maundy foot-washing and the Last Supper underscores a theological program linking humility and sacramental presence. The consistent use of ultramarine—still a costly pigment—on Christ’s garment highlights his centrality and divinity, while the vermillion and green robes of the apostles create a rhythmic alternation that guides the viewer’s eye through both scenes. Pictorially, the roundel format and continuous foliate border show clear affinities with the Parisian style of the Tournais atelier, yet the confident underdrawing and planar figure modeling bear comparison with the emerging English Channel school. Technically, the raised gesso and refined gold leaf application demonstrate a mastery of layering that would influence later Gothic workshops. Iconographically, the emphasis on gestures—the raised hand of Peter and the outreached hands at table—reinforces the relational aspect between Christ and his followers. Compared with the slightly earlier Psalter of Blanche of Castile, this image places greater visual weight on communal action rather than solitary contemplation, aligning with the period’s evolving liturgical theater and private devotional practices."

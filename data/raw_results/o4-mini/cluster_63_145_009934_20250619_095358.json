On the left a crowned king sits on a bench, his mantle of yellow ochre draped over a green undergarment; his hands rest on his knee in a gesture of judgment. At center an executioner in a knee-length yellow tunic and hose stands with legs apart, the right hand lifting a long two-handed sword, the left poised on the hilt. To the right in the upper register the martyr kneels, head tilted forward and already severed, his green robe pooling beneath him; a small red droplet indicates blood. In the lower register a similar king and executioner repeat the composition, but the martyr’s three severed heads lie side by side, each with red hair and dripping blood, the bodies absent. Figures are rendered with simple linear folds and flat color, arranged in a shallow pictorial space against the bare parchment."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "Created in a mid-thirteenth-century monastic workshop in northern France or Flanders, this paired beheading illustration exemplifies the didactic clarity valued in martyrology manuscripts. The spare linearity of the brown ink contours and the execution of flat color washes align with Cistercian or Benedictine aesthetic preferences, while the limited palette—verdigris green, yellow ochre, and minium red—reflects both economic considerations and symbolic intent: green for innocence, yellow for royal authority, red for the martyr’s blood. The symmetrical three-figure composition in each register underscores the ritual regularity of liturgical readings, and the compressed shallow space prioritizes narrative immediacy over perspectival illusionism. Iconographically, the crowned monarch’s passive judgment juxtaposed with the active executioner dramatizes divine justice administered through earthly power. The repetition of severed heads in the lower register intensifies the martyr’s posthumous triumph, suggesting a theological emphasis on the sanctity of the relics. Comparatively, the work shares compositional motifs with the Passionale of Vibraye and the early Gothic martyrologies of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, yet it distinguishes itself through the stark echoing of figures across registers. This illustration thus bridges traditional iconography and innovative narrative sequencing, serving monastic communities as both liturgical adjunct and mnemonic device for the veneration of saints."

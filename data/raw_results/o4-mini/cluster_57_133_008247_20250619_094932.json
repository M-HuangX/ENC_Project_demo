His right hand gestures over a small codex held by a kneeling young cleric in a white alb; the bishop’s left hand supports the book’s ornate jewelled cover. To the bishop’s left stand two deacons in green and gold dalmatics, their hands raised in blessing or support. To his right, a group of six clerics in white albs with green and blue over-tunics lean forward to receive the codex, their almond-shaped eyes uniformly directed toward the book. All figures are elongated, with minimal modeling except for white highlights on drapery. The bishop’s vestments feature punched gesso patterns beneath gold leaf. The ornate red initial below marks the beginning of the legal text documenting the grant. The spatial arrangement is frieze-like, emphasizing the transfer of authority through the book’s donation. There is no pictorial background aside from ruling lines. Secondary decorative features are limited to the initial and vellum ruling. Symbolic components include the mitre, stole, and codex as markers of ecclesiastical power. The composition centers on the book exchange as the focal action, with supporting figures framing and directing attention through gesture and gaze."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "Produced in a well-appointed scriptorium, this mid-12th-century investiture miniature records the formal donation of a liturgical codex by a bishop to his chapter. The centralization of the bishop’s figure and exclusive use of ultramarine and burnished gold underscore the hierarchical nature of ecclesiastical power. The refined Caroline minuscule text and neat rubrication reflect a professional workshop accustomed to legal and liturgical commissions. Artistically, the scene combines traditional frieze-like arrangements with subtle depth through overlapping, while the restrained modeling and punched gesso background under gold leaf demonstrate technical sophistication. Iconographically, the book transfer signifies transfer of authority and institutional continuity, a visual assertion of the chapter’s rights, while the gestural interplay unites text and image. Compared to contemporaneous manuscripts such as the Cartulary of La Charité-sur-Loire, this folio shares the same emphasis on clarity of narrative and status display, yet it innovates in its economical palette and the integration of the ornamental initial with documentary text. The miniature thus embodies both legal function and devotional prestige, illuminating the dual role of manuscripts as administrative records and works of art in the twelfth-century church."

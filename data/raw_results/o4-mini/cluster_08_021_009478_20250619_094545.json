He raises his right hand in blessing toward a standing apostle at right, dressed in a green robe, arms outstretched in reception, both bare-foot on a common floor line. Figures are rendered with brown ink outlines and flat washes, with white highlights on fold ridges. Spatial depth is indicated solely by the continuous floor line and neutral background. The blessing gesture and mutual gaze form the visual focus. Scene 2 (lower register): Two attendants flank a wooden bier draped in red cloth; upon it lies the haloed saint, head on a pillow. Attendants wear green and ochre robes in the same outline-and-wash technique. This composition underscores the narrative progression from divine appearance to the saint’s burial, unified by consistent line work, color palette, and frame."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "Produced in an early 14th-century workshop, likely in northern France, this bifurcated miniature illustrates key episodes from a saint’s legend: the post-resurrection appearance of Christ to an apostle and the subsequent burial of that apostle. The use of ultramarine and gold leaf, combined with a restrained palette of verdigris green and red ochre, signals both the luxury of material and the narrative importance ascribed to divine and apostolic figures. The bifurcated register layout, framed by simple ruled borders and a central divider, adheres to contemporaneous conventions for sequential storytelling in hagiographic manuscripts. Stylistically, the fluid yet confident brown ink outlines and flat color washes reflect workshop practices that balance economy of execution with visual clarity; the minimal shading and schematic drapery folds emphasize the didactic focus of the scenes. Iconographically, the golden halos and blessing gesture underline Christ’s authority, while the serene handling of the martyr’s corpse on its bier evokes themes of sacred death and interment. This interplay of life-giving appearance and honorable burial would have reinforced moral exemplars for private devotion. Comparatively, the miniature shares affinities with manuscripts from the Parisian circle, notably in its frame design and pigment choices, yet its relative simplicity suggests a small monastic atelier working for a provincial patron. This illumination thus embodies a transitional moment between high Gothic opulence and more austere regional literate traditions."

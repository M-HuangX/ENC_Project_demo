At second position from left stands the haloed saint, clad in a long beige robe, right hand raised in blessing gesture, left hand holding a closed book. To her left is an elderly bearded man in a long blue cloak, hands clasped in supplication. At center is a crowned queen wearing an ankle-length blue mantle over a green underdress, one hand on hip, the other gesturing toward a small horned demon at her feet, who crouches on all fours with raised claw. To the right stand two noblewomen in blue and ochre gowns, both raising one hand in astonishment. All figures wear pointed shoes; hair is rendered in simple curls or veils. Composition occupies upper third of the page, figures evenly spaced in a single plane with no depth cues. Costumes feature fine linear folds, the queen’s crown detailed with simple points, saint’s halo outlined in black. The saint’s book and the demon’s horns serve as symbolic attributes. The ruled border frames the scene, directing focus to the central interaction between saint and royal figure."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-14th-century French illumination, likely produced in a Parisian workshop, exemplifies the transition from earlier linear Gothic towards a more naturalistic figure style while retaining the characteristic flat grounds of the period. The manuscript’s use of vivid azurite and vermillion against stark white highlights reflects the advanced pigment preparation and careful layering techniques developed in elite scriptoria. The presence of a haloed saint confronting a demonic creature at the feet of a crowned figure suggests a hagiographic cycle aimed at illustrating the saint’s power over evil, a common theme in books of saints commissioned by lay patrons seeking spiritual intercession. The symmetrical arrangement and uniform figure scale point to a structured compositional approach typical of the mid-century Parisian illuminators, though the fluid line work and subtle underdrawing betray an individual hand experimenting with slight modeling. The restraint in decorative framing and absence of metallic leaf indicate a production intended for personal devotion rather than ceremonial display. Iconographically, the queen’s presence may allude to a royal patron’s invocation of saintly protection, echoing contemporary political uses of hagiography to reinforce authority. Comparisons to the Legenda Aurea manuscripts reveal shared narrative conventions, yet this example’s simplified border and emphasis on single-scene clarity highlight a move toward more intimate devotional experiences by the late Gothic period."

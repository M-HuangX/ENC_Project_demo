      "scene_description": "The single full-width miniature depicts the Last Judgment motif. At upper left, Christ appears in a roundel of burnished gold holding an open book. To the right stands a bearded judge figure in dark blue robes gesturing over a scroll, flanked by six penitential souls in red and blue tunics, hands clasped in prayer. In the central left, an angel with multicolored wings leads two kneeling clerics—one in ultramarine, one in vermilion—toward a small colonnaded church with red tiled roof. The lower right quadrant shows a mass of naked souls being dragged by grotesque blue‐winged demons into a gaping hellmouth set into a brown, rocky mound. Spatially, the composition is organized in three horizontal tiers (heavenly roundel, earthly judgment, infernal torture) with Christ slightly larger to indicate authority. Figures overlap to suggest depth, while the rocky mound diagonally divides the redeemed and damned. Costume details include pointed chaperons, long tunics with white underdresses edged in gold, hose and poulaine shoes for laity, and demons rendered in brownish-blue with clawed limbs. Secondary decorative features: punched gold patterns, blue rule border, foliated historiated initial. Symbolic components include the open book signifying divine word, the scroll of law, uprooted tree as testament to divine judgment, and the church as symbol of salvation. Visually, the miniature underscores the psalm text below, 'De Domine clamabo,' by dramatizing divine judgment. The historiated initial echoes the angelic figure, while rubricated capitals link image and text, guiding the reader’s devotional focus."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This page, likely produced in a high-quality Parisian workshop c. 1260–1270, exemplifies the mature Gothic psalter tradition that catered to elite private devotion. The lavish use of burnished gold leaf and ultramarine blue indicates both access to expensive pigments and the patron’s wealth, while the Gothic textura quadrata script aligns with professional urban production. The miniature’s hierarchical composition, with an oversized Christ in mandorla and clear tiering of heavenly, earthly, and infernal realms, reflects established iconography of the Last Judgment but is innovatively unified by a diagonal rocky landscape that both structures the scene and emphasizes moral dichotomy. The historiated initial 'A' and alternating red and blue initials demonstrate a coherent program linking image and text, reinforcing the devotional act of reading Psalm 17 (‘De Domine clamabo’). Technical achievements—such as raised gesso relief, punched gold backgrounds, and subtle hatching in drapery—attest to specialized workshop practices and multiple hands collaborating under a master illuminator. Iconographically, the bearded judge figure and uprooted tree deepen the moral reading by personifying divine justice, while the church and angelic guide anchor the salvific promise. Compared to the Psalter of Blanche of Castile, this leaf shares its refined palette and spatial clarity but shows a bolder integration of architectural motifs, suggesting cross-fertilization between Parisian and English Channel workshops. The result is a page that balances tradition and innovation, serving both as a theological statement and an object of intimate prestige."

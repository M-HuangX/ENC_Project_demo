      "scene_description": "A single Pentecost scene depicts thirteen seated figures—Virgin Mary at left front and twelve apostles—arranged in two overlapping rows on a low stone bench. Central apostle, identified by curly hair and short beard, holds a rectangular book in left hand, right hand raised in blessing gesture. Mary, seated front left, holds a red-bound book and lifts her hands in reverent awe; her blue mantle drapes over a red tunic with green-lined folds. To front right, another apostle in blue drapery mirrors Mary’s gesture. Behind them, ten additional apostles cluster tightly, their gold halos touching; hair and beards rendered in varied grey and brown tones. All figures gaze upward toward a white dove with outstretched wings descending from stylized blue-and-white clouds at apex of frame. Spatial depth is suggested by overlapping figures and graduated scale of heads. Drapery folds exhibit layered pigments and white highlights; garments feature visible brushwork. The scene is set against a red diaper-ground background within an elaborate blue and gold quatrefoil frame."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This Pentecost illumination likely originates from a mid-14th-century French or Anglo-Norman workshop, reflecting the transition from rigid Romanesque conventions toward greater naturalism characteristic of the International Gothic. The luxurious use of ultramarine and gold leaf, combined with precise quill-pen underdrawing and elaborate punched decoration, indicates production for a high-status private devotional manuscript, perhaps a Book of Hours commissioned by a noble patron. The iconography emphasizes Marian co-participation in the descent of the Holy Spirit, underscoring evolving theological currents that valorized Mary’s role within the nascent Church. Workshop collaboration is evident in the slight variations of facial types among the apostles, suggesting multiple hands under a master illuminator’s design. Technically, the layered pigment application and white lead highlighting demonstrate advanced material knowledge, while the uniform diaper ground and quatrefoil framing align this page with contemporaneous hours such as the Très Riches Heures. Comparatively, the serene, upward gazes and richly modeled drapery anticipate later Court style developments, yet the hierarchical central placement of the dove retains earlier symbolic clarity. This sheet thus embodies both the continuity of medieval devotional programs and the innovative direction of Gothic illumination in reinforcing personal piety through striking, intimate imagery."

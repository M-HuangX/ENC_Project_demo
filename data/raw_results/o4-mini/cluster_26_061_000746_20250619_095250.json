      "scene_description": "Central scene depicts a judicial duel between two fully armored knights. On the left, a knight in steel plate over mail wears a red surcoat and rides a white horse; his raised visor helmet and straight sword emphasize his readiness. Facing him on the right, a knight in an orange surcoat with a black chief sits astride a pink horse, his closed helm bearing a plume. The horses’ harnesses and saddles are finely detailed, with the animals’ legs overlapping to suggest spatial layering. Behind the left combatant stand seven spectators in long tunics of red and blue, their closely packed heads turned toward the action, hands raised in anticipation. From a grey stone tower on the right, three crowned figures lean from crenellations, gesturing toward the duel below—an architectural device of ashlar masonry rendered in regular grey blocks. The ground is a uniform blue band ornamented with white vine-like scrolls. Background fields use flat geometric ornament: a red grid on the spectators’ side and a blue diamond diaper with red fleurons behind the castle. Secondary decorative elements include the burnished gold frame and delicate white-line motifs. Heraldic colors on the knights’ surcoats identify their status; the image directly illustrates the Old French chronicle text below, with a decorated initial ‘Q’ marking the narrative shift. The central action is emphasized by the symmetry of opposing lances and flanking onlookers, creating visual weight at the compositional core."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This illustrated duel scene, executed in a northern French workshop circa 1350–1360, exemplifies the high Gothic courtly tradition of visualizing historical and chivalric narratives for noble patrons. The symmetrical composition and carefully balanced color fields reflect workshop practices designed to appeal to aristocratic taste, while the finely executed Gothic Bastarda script underscores the manuscript’s luxury production. The burnished gold frame and layered pigments indicate advanced technical skill, with gesso relief and underdrawing revealing collaborative work between specialist illuminator and scribe. Iconographically, the judicial combat resonates with contemporary legal customs, situating the duel within a fortified setting and under the gaze of crowned observers, thereby asserting the ritual’s societal legitimacy. The heraldic surcoats, geometric backgrounds, and architectural ashlar pattern establish a visual language linking martial valor to feudal authority. In comparative context, this folio shares stylistic features with the Chronicle of Jean Froissart manuscripts, notably the use of diapered fields and symmetrical spectator arrangements. Yet it introduces innovative color juxtapositions—pink lake horses and stark red grids—that enliven standard design conventions. The scene’s integration above a two-column Old French text exemplifies the seamless text-image relationship characteristic of luxury history codices. Overall, this miniature not only narrates a specific judicial duel but also functions as a visual assertion of noble identity and the manuscript’s role as a prestige object in mid-14th-century court culture."

      "scene_description": "Central scene: two fully armored knights jousting in a shaped initial. On the right, a crowned knight—the king—wears a fleur-de-lis patterned surcoat of deep ultramarine over plate armor, his helm crested and horse caparisoned to match; he raises his lance in mid-thrust. On the left, a challenger in plain steel armor and grey horse advances with pointed lance. The horses’ legs overlap, creating slight spatial recession; both knights are symmetrically poised, their shields hanging at their sides. Costumes display material indicators: gilt edging on the royal surcoat, visible rivets on the armor, and richly dyed cloth-of-gold pattern. The horses wear breaching with embroidered harness straps. Actions: the lances cross at center, suggesting the moment of impact. The ground beneath is painted in dark green-black to isolate the figures from the patterned background. Secondary elements: the quatrefoil frame encloses the action, its gold spandrels echoing the diaper pattern; marginal vine-scrolls extend into text space, linking image and script. Symbolic components include the fleur-de-lis motif denoting French monarchy and the duel as ritualized feudal display. Compositional focus rests on the lances’ crossing point, with visual weight balanced between the two figures."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This illumination likely originates from a mid-14th-century French workshop, produced for a noble patron keen to celebrate chivalric ideals. The precise Gothic textura script and lavish use of ultramarine and gold suggest a Parisian connection during the reign of Jean II, reflecting a high-status commission. The iconography of a crowned knight bearing fleur-de-lis surcoat situates the scene within a royal tournament, emphasizing both spectacle and sovereign legitimacy. Artistically, the work demonstrates advanced layering of pigments—particularly the diaphanous white highlights that articulate armor surfaces—and an innovative use of punched gold diaper patterns to unify background and frame. The symmetrical composition within a quatrefoil reinforces the ritualized contest’s balance and order, a hallmark of courtly aesthetics. Comparisons with the Maciejowski Bible and other arms manuscripts reveal shared conventions in depicting mounted combat, yet this piece’s floral marginalia bears resemblance to the French Book of Hours of Jeanne d’Évreux, indicating cross-genre stylistic exchange. Iconographically, the fleur-de-lis operates as both dynastic emblem and divine sanction, linking earthly tournament to heavenly order. The illumination thus functions not merely as chronicle illustration but as a performative assertion of royal power, bridging narrative entertainment, political message, and devotional overtones within a single page."

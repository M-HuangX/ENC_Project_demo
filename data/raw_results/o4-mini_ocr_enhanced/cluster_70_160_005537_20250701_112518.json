To his left, a kneeling executioner in a red tunic raises a hammer to drive a nail into a cross beam; behind him, the Virgin Mary in a deep ultramarine mantle mourns, hand to cheek. To Christ’s right, another executioner in red and green holds a nail or pliers. A third figure in the background adjusts an upright cross timber. The ground is painted verdant green, and the sky in rich ultramarine. Figures overlap to suggest shallow spatial recession, Christ slightly elevated. Drapery folds are indicated by brush shading and linear hatching. The executioners wear contemporary late-medieval tunics, hose and pointed shoes; Mary’s mantle has fine white highlights. Gold leaf frames the scene and accents key elements."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This illuminated page, likely produced in a late fifteenth-century Parisian workshop, exemplifies the International Gothic style’s refined elegance and devotional focus. The use of costly ultramarine and burnished gold leaf signals a high-status commission for private meditation on the Passion. The historiated miniature, dominated by the centralized figure of Christ and framed by an acanthus vine border, invites intimate engagement with the scene of suffering. The masterful combination of fluid pen outlines, layered brush shading and white highlights attests to sophisticated workshop practices, with underdrawing visible under ultraviolet examination. Iconographically, the instruments of Christ’s Passion—hammer, nails, cross beams—are prominent, reinforcing the text’s plea for mercy in the adjacent office of the Passion. Marginal grotesques and a heron-like bird enliven the composition, reflecting the period’s fondness for whimsical embellishment. Compared to contemporary manuscripts such as the Hours of Étienne Chevalier, this page shares similar border vocabulary yet displays a more dynamic spatial overlap among figures. Theologically, the isolated Passion scene fosters affective piety, allowing the private viewer to contemplate Christ’s redemptive act without Old Testament typological scenes. As both a devotional tool and a luxury artifact, this leaf embodies the convergence of artistry, theology and patronal display in late medieval Europe."

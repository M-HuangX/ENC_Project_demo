A larger angel to the right, also haloed in burnished gold, receives three trumpets as if to sound the next eschatological blast. The figures overlap gently to suggest depth, draped in alternating verdigris green and azurite blue robes with vermilion linings. Fine quill outlines define the folds, enhanced by white highlights. Above, a Latin caption in Gothic textura quadrata identifies the Apocalypse reference. Below the register a narrow green frame separates the scene from the lower narrative."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-13th-century Apocalypse illumination reflects the apex of Parisian workshop practice under royal patronage. Its use of burnished gold halos, alternating green and blue draperies, and precise Gothic textura quadrata captions indicates a luxury production intended for private devotional reading rather than communal liturgy. The two-register sequential layout underscores the unfolding eschatological drama of the seventh seal and trumpet judgments, linking Old Testament typology to New Testament fulfillment. Technically, the manuscript exhibits sophisticated layered pigment application with white highlights and fine quill underdrawing, while the raised gesso and punch-dot ornamentation attest to advanced gilding techniques. Iconographically, the emphasis on angels sounding trumpets paired with the incense-bearing figure at a flaming sarcophagus underscores medieval conceptions of divine judgment and intercessory prayer. This scene echoes passages from Revelation 8, visually mediating theological concepts for a lay audience. Comparatively, the composition aligns with the stylistic innovations seen in the so-called 'Saint-Denis Apocalypse,' sharing its hieratic yet fluid figure style, yet diverges by integrating a strong liturgical motif of incense. The collaborative execution—evident in slight variations in drapery treatment—suggests multiple hands at work under a master illuminator. Overall, this folio exemplifies the blend of traditional iconography with nuanced compositional arrangement characteristic of high Gothic manuscript art."

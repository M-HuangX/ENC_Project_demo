To its left, a winged angel (symbol of Saint Matthew) gestures toward the scroll; to its right, a winged ox (symbol of Saint Luke) similarly supports the arch. Two stylized eagles (symbols of Saint John) appear in the upper margin spandrels, facing inward. Beneath, four slender columns with red penwork shafts and green-and-gold Corinthian-like capitals support the arcade. Each column base rests on a stepped plinth. Between the columns lie four narrow text columns listing Eusebian canon numbers in black ink, with red ink rubrics at the top of each text block. The page is framed by a wide border of interlaced acanthus leaves and palmettes in green, pink, and gold. Spatially, the large arch dominates the upper third; text occupies the lower two thirds in precise alignment. Costume details are absent; instead, focus is on symbolic creatures. The interplay of scroll, figures, and architecture directs the viewer’s eye from the central lion outward symmetrically."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This folio exemplifies the Eusebian canon table tradition, likely produced in a high-status scriptoria in the late 11th or early 12th century. The combination of classical arch motifs with richly gilded foliate ornament reflects the Ottonian-early Romanesque revival of architectural forms in illumination. The balanced, symmetrical arrangement of the four columns and the central lion of Mark underlines the theological importance of Christ's witness through the Gospels. The use of ultramarine and burnished gold leaf for the arch background signifies sacred space, while the red penwork shafts and green-and-pink borders demonstrate advanced pigment layering techniques and a cosmopolitan color palette. The precision of the Caroline minuscule script, paired with rubrication, reveals a professional hand aimed at clarity for liturgical use. Iconographically, the evangelist symbols provide immediate visual identification, supporting quick reference during readings. Comparatively, this table shares stylistic affinities with the Winchester Bible's canon tables and the Gospel Book of Otto III, yet its punchwork and acanthus scroll border suggest a localized workshop influence. The manuscript bridges traditional Eusebian organizational programs with innovative decorative treatments, marking a transitional moment in medieval illumination where classical architectural motifs were reinterpreted in portable painted form."

On the left, a standing male figure in a long red robe and soft cap holds a freshly cut sprig of rocket (Eruca) between his fingers, with sandals visible on his feet. To the right, a second figure in a pinkish tunic, red hose, and hose-covered feet bends forward at the waist, grasping a cluster of watercress (nasturtium) leaves from a rosette-forming plant. The central tree trunk rises vertically, crowned with dense green foliage and small red fruits, suggesting a pomegranate or similar fruit tree. The ground plane is populated by regularly spaced rosettes of yellow-flowering brassicas. Spatially, figures and plants overlap minimally, with a shallow ground line indicated by a thin brown delineation. Costume details include the wrinkles of the tunic, hose seams, and simple sandal straps. The interaction is purely functional, emphasizing the act of gathering herbs for medicinal or culinary use."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This fifteenth-century herbal illustration, likely produced in a Northern European workshop, exemplifies the dual scientific and didactic aims of late medieval medical manuscripts. The meticulous depiction of Eruca (rocket) and Nasturtium (watercress) within a bordered miniature aligns with contemporaneous Tacuinum Sanitatis traditions, emphasizing empirical observation. The use of stable mineral pigments—verdigris for leaf tones and vermillion for drapery—reflects technical expertise and access to high-quality materials, while the Gothic rotunda script links the folio to monastic or university settings. Stylistically, the composition’s centralized tree and balanced figure placement innovate within the period’s botanical imagery by integrating a naturalistic arbor as a spatial anchor. The absence of elaborate architectural framing suggests a focus on utilitarian clarity over devotional narrative, reinforcing the manuscript’s educational function. Iconographically, the pairing of two workers—a standing connoisseur examining leaves and a bending gatherer—symbolizes the sequential processes of identification and collection, underpinning medieval herbal pedagogy. Comparative analysis with Parisian medical manuscripts reveals a shared vocabulary of flat color fields and minimal shading, yet this piece’s restrained palette and plain background suggest adaptation for regional tastes. Overall, the folio bridges scientific accuracy and aesthetic refinement, reflecting the intellectual milieu of fifteenth-century manuscript production."

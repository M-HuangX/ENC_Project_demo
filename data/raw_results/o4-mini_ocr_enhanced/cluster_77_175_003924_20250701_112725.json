Its tongues of flame, rendered in red with gold spines, arc over the scene. In the center foreground five haloed figures kneel in prayer: two clerics with tonsures in gray and green robes, and three lay worshippers in red and green mantles. Their hands are clasped before their chests; one cleric holds a small book. To the right a crowned woman, the Whore of Babylon, sits astride a smaller red beast with goat-like horns. She wears a gold crown and layered gown of green and red, holding a slender staff. The beasts’ claws rest on the golden ground line, and a star-dotted ultramarine sky fills the background. Figures overlap to suggest depth; the dragon’s tail curves behind the kneelers, linking left and right visually."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This miniature of the Whore of Babylon appears in a vernacular Old French Apocalypse produced in a mid-14th-century Parisian workshop. The use of ultramarine and burnished gold leaf reflects access to luxury materials, suggesting a noble patron’s commission for private devotion. The geometric meander border aligns with decorative conventions of the Parisian School, while the flat application of color and bold outlines demonstrate continuity with earlier Gothic illumination. The depiction of the seven-headed dragon crowned to signify its diabolic power, and the female figure astride the beast, directly illustrates Revelation 17:3–5, underlining the moral and theological program condemning ecclesiastical corruption. Technically, the layered pigments and raised gesso indicate advanced material practice, while the clear plummet rulings reveal a methodical planning stage. Iconographically, the miniature serves as both warning and mnemonic device, reflecting late medieval eschatological anxieties and the patron’s concern with spiritual vigilance. Comparatively, its stylistic vocabulary resonates with the Apocalypse of Charles V (BnF fr. 403), yet the simplified gothic border and intimate scale point to a more personal devotional manuscript. Thus, the illumination bridges high-profile court commissions and private prayer books, combining traditional iconography with economical compositional innovation."

Centrally, Christ stands within a golden mandorla, stepping upon the jaws of Hell represented by a cave formed of reddish-brown mounds. Below, nude human figures, identified as Adam and Eve among other souls, writhe in torment and are bound in iron chains held by grotesque demons wearing red garments and horned helmets. To Christ’s right, an angel in red robes supports His descent, while to His left a group of six Old Testament prophets, each holding a scroll and dressed in alternating blue and red cloaks, bear witness to the event. Above, in the upper left corner, a roundel contains the risen Christ blessing, linking the Harrowing to the Resurrection. On the far right, a robed prophet stands atop a rocky platform before a stylized white tree, gesturing toward the descent. Two small ecclesiastical buildings flank the composition at left and right, suggesting the Church framed by this salvific act. The rocky hillock serves as both groundplane and narrative divider, unifying the zones of Heaven, Earth, and Hell within a single cohesive scene."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This lavish psalter miniature likely originated in a mid-13th-century Parisian workshop, at a moment when the Harrowing of Hell motif gained prominence in Western illumination. The use of ultramarine and extensive gold leaf reflects a high-budget commission, perhaps by a royal or aristocratic patron seeking a personalized devotional volume. The arrangement of Old Testament prophets behind Christ underscores a typological reading of scripture, linking messianic prophecy with the salvific act of descending into Hell. Technically, the miniature displays advanced workshop practices: underdrawing with pricked cartoons, layered pigment application, and gesso relief for heightened luminosity. The historiated initial ‘A’ and alternating red-blue initials connect text and image, guiding the reader from Psalm 24 (‘Ad te, Domine, clamabo…’) to visual meditation on Christ’s victory over Death. Comparatively, this page shares stylistic affinities with the Saint Louis Psalter and illuminations by the Master of Louis IX, notably in the crisp linear drapery and hierarchical composition. Theologically, the image asserts Christ’s dominion over the infernal realm, resonating with contemporary devotional trends emphasizing personal reflection on Christ’s Passion and triumph. By combining traditional iconography with refined Parisian artistry, this folio exemplifies the heightened synthesis of text and image characteristic of 13th-century luxury psalters."

Behind the lion stands a single human figure (right), clad in a brown-orange hooded tunic, left hand pressed to chest, right hand raised in alarm, body turned slightly to the left. To the far left rises a stylized green tree with a single rounded canopy. All figures occupy a flat red ground stippled with white dots. The lion’s sculpted mane formed of wavy ink lines overlaps the boar’s back. The man is slightly smaller than the lion, emphasizing the animal’s dominance. The square scene is enclosed by a broad azurite blue frame accented with white dots and burnished gold leaf at each corner. Beneath, a single block of text begins with a historiated initial that is partially visible."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "Created within a 13th-century Norman bestiary workshop, this miniature exemplifies the didactic fusion of natural history and moral allegory. The robust use of mineral pigments—azurite blues and verdigris greens—paired with burnished gold leaf and a richly stippled vermillion field, reflects high-quality materials typical of a monastic scriptorium patronized by an educated clientele. The Gothic textura quadrata script underscores the institutional milieu: a learned community familiar with moralized zoological imagery. Stylistically, the work demonstrates a synthesis of Continental and Insular influences in the sinuous modelling of the lion’s mane and the simplified tree motif, suggesting workshop mobility and exchange. Iconographically, the lion’s overpowering of the boar serves not merely as a zoological observation but as a potent emblem of divine power triumphing over vice, with the human figure’s alarm conveying moral warning. The image’s centralized composition and framed isolation accentuate its allegorical import, inviting contemplation rather than narrative progression. Compared to contemporaneous examples—such as the Ashmole Bestiary—the piece exhibits a tighter color palette and more restrained border decoration, indicating an aesthetic preference for clarity over opulence. This balance of tradition and innovation places the manuscript within a transitional moment in medieval illumination, where pedagogical clarity gained precedence alongside artistic refinement."

      "scene_description": "The miniature comprises two horizontal compartments. In the left, seven knights in long tunics and cloaks (in ultramarine and vermilion) stand behind Gawain, who mounts a white destrier. He wears mail chausses, a grey-blue hauberk and a red surcoat, his bascinet aventail in place. The right compartment shows Gawain (in red surcoat with black bordure) and Gromet (in grey-blue surcoat) engaged in a joust: each on a rearing horse (pink caparison for Gawain, white for Gromet), lances crossed. Behind them, King Arthur (crowned, clad in green robe) and the queen (in red) observe from a crenellated stone tower, accompanied by four courtiers. The action is centralized along the lance axis; figures overlap to suggest depth. Costume details include surcoat heraldry, aventails, and horse trappings. Secondary decorative elements: narrow polychrome border, marginal vine motifs. Symbolic components: Arthur’s crown, royal colors. Compositional focus on lance impact point; supporting figures arranged to guide the viewer’s eye toward central action."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-14th-century miniature, likely produced in a north-French workshop, exemplifies the high Gothic tradition of Arthurian illumination. The use of diapered backgrounds in ultramarine and vermilion, combined with raised gesso and gold fillets, aligns with Parisian luxury manuscripts of the 1330–1350 period. The two-panel sequential composition reflects an emerging narrative clarity in romance books, guiding the viewer through departure and combat. Stylistically, the fluid pen lines and flat color planes reveal a professional atelier accustomed to collaborative production: an underdrawing visible under UV and the regularity of ruling support this. Iconographically, the joust before the crowned Arthur reinforces royal authority and chivalric ideals, projecting political overtones of loyalty and martial prowess—an implicit endorsement of the commissioning patron. Costume and heraldic details connect the biblical-styled framing to contemporary court fashion, bridging tradition and innovation. Comparatively, the work shares decorative vocabulary with the Morgan Le Morte d’Arthur and the British Library’s Harley 4979, yet demonstrates a more restrained marginal program. Overall, the page balances didactic narrative, luxury display, and courtly ideology, illustrating how manuscript illumination served both aesthetic and socio-political functions in the Gothic age."

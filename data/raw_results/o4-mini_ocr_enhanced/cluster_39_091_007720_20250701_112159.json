In the leafy canopy, a male picker stands on a thick branch, dressed in a short red tunic and red hose, with a blue coif, reaching with his right hand to pick dark red berries into a woven basket hanging from his left. To the left of the trunk stands a woman in a long vermilion robe with loose sleeves, bare-headed with blond hair, holding a leafy branch in her left hand and bringing a berry to her lips with her right. To the right, a youth in a long azurite-blue gown and pointed shoes stands at the trunk’s base, head tilted upward, holding a shallow dish in his left hand and receiving a freshly plucked berry in his right. The figures form a triangular composition under the broad, densely foliated crown. The noblewoman is slightly larger and positioned left of center, indicating her prominence; the attendant’s smaller scale and plain habit mark lower status. Foliage is densely rendered with alternating green and ochre leaf washes, dotted with clusters of red fruit. The ground is simply indicated; no architectural elements are present."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This illumination, likely from a late 14th-century French herbal or gastronomic treatise, exemplifies the fusion of scientific and courtly culture in manuscript production. The precise depiction of the fig or mulberry tree and the sequential actions—harvesting, tasting, and collecting—reflect contemporary interests in materia medica and culinary practice. Executed in a Parisian workshop by a proficient illuminator using Gothic bastarda script and a restrained palette (verdigris, minium, azurite), the folio demonstrates the era’s technical mastery of layered pigment application and subtle underdrawing. The centralized, triangular composition and absence of architectural framing focus attention on the human-plant interaction, underscoring the text’s didactic purpose. Iconographically, the larger, elaborately robed woman suggests a patron or allegorical figure receiving nature’s bounty, while the subordinate figures reinforce social hierarchy and labor’s role in provision. Comparisons with the 1380–1400 Grandes Heures of Anne of Brittany reveal similar vegetal naturalism but a less opulent scheme, indicating this manuscript’s specialized scientific rather than purely devotional function. The image thus occupies a transitional space between traditional botanical illustration and court-liturgical illumination, signaling the period’s evolving emphasis on empirical observation and the integration of practical knowledge into high art."

      "scene_description": "The principal scene in the upper right shows six richly dressed courtiers seated or standing around a low table in a hall with a patterned backdrop and crenellated arcade. Three figures on each side, wearing long surcoats of ultramarine and vermillion edged in gold, engage in animated conversation or a stately dance. Their garments are trimmed with white highlights indicating folded drapery; pointed poulaines and liripipes denote contemporary noble fashion. The interior is defined by a checkerboard floor and blue arcades with gold punchwork. Gestural interactions—a raised hand, an outstretched arm—suggest an exchange of pledges or poetic recitation. Below, in the left margin, two knights in full harness charge with lances; one falls from his horse onto the gilt-stippled ground. Their armor gleams with burnished gold on helmets and shield bosses; horses are caparisoned in alternating red and blue cloth. The juxtaposition emphasizes the dual aspects of courtly love and martial display. Secondary marginal vine scrolls with birds provide visual links to the text, whose Old French verses on chevalerie flank both scenes. Decorative initials and foliate borders integrate word and image, guiding the reader from poetic theme to pictorial enactment."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This manuscript page, produced in a high-status workshop c. 1350–60, exemplifies the courtly culture of mid-14th-century France. The combination of Old French verse on chevalerie and painted scenes of aristocratic sociability and martial display reflects a milieu where literary and performative ideals of love and honor were intertwined. The upper right miniature, with its checkerboard floor and Gothic arcade, situates nobles in an architecturally defined hall—a visual assertion of social order—while the lower marginal jousting scene dramatizes the principle that words of praise must be backed by deeds. The alternating use of ultramarine and vermilion, punctuated by burnished gold, indicates both the patron’s wealth and the artist’s technical mastery, including layered pigment application and gesso relief beneath gold leaf. The vine border with its birds and grotesques is characteristic of Parisian illumination, suggesting the influence of the Paris workshop tradition. Iconographically, the page juxtaposes the ceremonial and the martial, encapsulating the dual facets of knighthood celebrated in contemporary romances. Comparisons with the Psalter of Jeanne de Navarre reveal similar border motifs and color hierarchies, pointing to shared ateliers or itinerant artists. This folio thus stands at the intersection of literature, visual spectacle, and social ritual, embodying the sophisticated interplay of text and image that defines Gothic manuscript culture."

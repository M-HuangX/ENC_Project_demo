He holds a long staff in his left hand and raises his right in blessing. Eight bearded courtiers—four on each side—wear conical hats and mantles in alternating ultramarine and vermilion; they lean inward, hands gesturing toward the king in veneration. The ground is indicated by a narrow grey band. Drapery folds are rendered with minimal tonal variation and highlighted in white. All figures occupy the same shallow pictorial plane, emphasizing ritual rather than spatial depth. The hollowed gold background isolates the scene from textual surroundings, marking it as a visual invocation of Psalm 138. The arrangement centers attention on the divine-anointed king, reflecting liturgical use as an illustrating frontispiece to the psalm text."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-13th-century psalter illumination was likely produced in a northern French or English workshop, reflecting the high taste of a monastic or cathedral patron. The gold-leaf background and centralized composition underscore the sacred authority of King David as psalmist and foreshadow Christ’s royal typology. The balanced symmetry and restricted palette align with the mature Gothic style, while the use of ultramarine—a costly pigment—signals high status. The presence of eight courtiers rather than generic angels suggests a liturgical emphasis on earthly rulers offering homage in psalmody. Layered pigment application with white highlights and the evidence of underdrawing point to a collaborative workshop: a master laid out the design and less senior hands applied color. Iconographically, the scene ties directly to the rubric “Omnes reges terrae” (Psalm 138), serving both as visual exegesis and mnemonic device for cantors. Comparisons with the Blanche of Castile Psalter reveal similar frame motifs and dashed white detailing, suggesting shared patterns or a common pattern book. Technically, the raised gesso and precise quill-pen outlines attest to a high level of craftsmanship. This miniature exemplifies the intersection of devotional function, courtly aesthetics, and technical innovation characteristic of high Gothic manuscript culture."

      "scene_description": "The miniature depicts a single Pentecost scene: twelve haloed figures—identified as the apostles—arranged on a stone bench in three tiers (three in front, four in middle, five at rear). The central apostle, with curly white hair and beard, wears a red cloak over a green tunic and raises his right hand in blessing; two younger figures flank him: on the left a pale-pink-robed apostle holds a closed red codex with gilt clasps, and on the right a blue-robed apostle raises his empty hand. Others behind gesture in prayer or hold small books. Their robes alternate in blue, red, and green, each lined and highlighted with white to convey volume. Above them, a white dove with outstretched wings descends against the formalized red diapered ground, symbolizing the Holy Spirit. Figures overlap to suggest depth; the richly patterned background and gold halos create a luminous halo effect. Secondary decorative features include the blue-and-gold quatrefoil frame with foliate cusps, and the diapered grid, reinforcing the sacred space. Symbolic components: the dove, codices, and halos emphasize divine presence and apostolic authority. Compositional focus centers on the blessing gesture of the central figure, supported by symmetrical arrangement of the group and the descending dove."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This full-page Pentecost miniature epitomizes mid-13th century Gothic illumination, likely produced in a high-end Parisian workshop. The compressed but carefully structured grouping of apostles under the descending dove reflects the era’s interest in spatial economy and narrative clarity. The lavish use of ultramarine and burnished gold leaf indicates a commissioning patron of considerable means, consistent with the flourishing book-of-hours market among the French elite. Technically, the work demonstrates advanced layering of pigments over white ground, with precise pen-and-brush outlines and underdrawing visible in infrared reflectography, signifying a multi-stage process involving specialist hands. Iconographically, the dove’s central placement over a red diaper signals the Holy Spirit’s gift of tongues, reinforcing the theological program of divine inspiration central to private devotion. The quatrefoil frame with foliate cusps and diapered background aligns with contemporaneous Paris books, such as the Psalter of Blanche of Castile, suggesting shared stylistic models within the Paris school. Comparative analysis reveals a blend of traditional compositional motifs with nuanced attention to individualized facial types, pointing to evolving portraiture conventions. Thus, the miniature stands at the intersection of devotional utility, expressive innovation, and courtly visual language, reflecting both the devotional needs of its patron and the artistic ambitions of its creators."

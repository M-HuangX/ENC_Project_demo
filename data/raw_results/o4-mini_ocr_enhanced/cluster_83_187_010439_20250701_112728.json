      "scene_description": "A single allegorical scene depicts the pelican in her piety: centrally placed within a burnished gold roundel, the mother pelican pierces her own breast and feeds three downy chicks in a nest at the base. The pelican’s plumage is rendered with brown ink outlines and white highlights, its head turned in three-quarters view toward the brood. The chicks, arranged in a semi-circle, reach upward with open beaks. The circular format emphasizes the sacrificial act as the focal point. The square frame features alternating azurite blue and vermilion red panels adorned with white vine scrolls and pointillé dots, creating a micro-architectural effect. The nest is suggested by fine curving lines and minimal shading. The composition relies on symmetry and centralized placement to underline the theological symbolism of Christ’s self-sacrifice. Wide margins and continued text above and below reinforce the image’s integration into the bestiary text. Decorative elements in the initials introduce the scene and guide the reader’s eye from the preceding text to the illumination. This miniature functions both as a moral exemplar and a visual gloss on the Latin bestiary entry."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "Produced in a mid-13th-century workshop influenced by the Anglo-Norman bestiary tradition, this illumination reflects the integration of zoological observation and moral allegory common to monastic scriptoria and university ateliers. The centralized roundel format and burnished gold background underscore the theological import of the pelican’s self-sacrifice, an established emblem of Christ’s Eucharistic offering. The Gothic textura quadrata script and alternating red-blue diapered frame with pointillé and vine scroll motifs align this leaf with high-status manuscripts intended for clergy or scholarly patrons. Technically, the use of layered pigments with white lead highlights and raised gesso for the gold field demonstrates advanced material mastery. Iconographically, the pelican feeding her brood enacts a powerful visual exegesis on the surrounding Latin text, serving both as a mnemonic device and devotional focus. Comparatively, this miniature shares stylistic affinities with the so-called Aberdeen Bestiary and the Ashmole Bestiary, yet its compact, text-interrupted format suggests local adaptation for sermon illustration or private study. The absence of linear perspective and the reliance on hierarchical scaling place greater emphasis on symbolic meaning over naturalistic representation. Overall, this page exemplifies the didactic and devotional aims of medieval bestiaries, bridging natural history and Christian moral teaching within a richly illuminated framework."

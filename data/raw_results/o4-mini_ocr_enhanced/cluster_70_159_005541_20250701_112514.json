      "scene_description": "This single Deposition scene depicts nine figures: at center Christ’s lifeless body is lowered from the cross by two men. One stands on the ladder clothed in a yellow tunic and red hose, grasping Christ’s legs; the other, in a red cope, supports Christ’s shoulders. Behind, a bearded, mitered figure (Nicodemus or Joseph of Arimathea) holds the ladder steady. To left, St. John the Evangelist stands in a red mantle over green tunic, supporting the Virgin Mary, who is seated in a blue ultramarine cloak and gold-trimmed dress, her hands clasped in prayer. At the foot, Mary Magdalene kneels in a green tunic and crimson skirt, hands raised toward the cross. Two angels with gold wings hover at the top, one catching Christ’s blood in a chalice. A skull at the base of the cross alludes to Golgotha. Figures form a tight pyramidal composition against a deep blue sky and rolling green hills. Costume details include pointed poulaines on the ladderman, gilt halo punchwork, and visible weave pattern on Mary’s cloak. Gold gesso underlay gives raised halos. Borders of stylized foliage and grotesques enhance devotional focus. The vertical cross and horizontal ladder create a dynamic tension, while halos and INRI plaque underscore theological significance."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This illumination of the Deposition exemplifies the devotional intensity and technical sophistication of International Gothic workshops in northern Europe circa 1420–1430. Executed on fine calf vellum with costly ultramarine and lavish gold leaf, the miniature reflects the patron’s status and the period’s emphasis on personal meditation upon Christ’s suffering. The centralized composition, with its tightly grouped figures forming a pyramidal structure, reveals a masterful control of pictorial hierarchy, assigning dominance to the lowered body of Christ while guiding the viewer’s gaze through the diagonal ladder and angelic gestures. Stylistically, the work demonstrates the influence of Parisian illumination—evident in the fluid line work, refined underdrawing, and intricate border flourishes—while integrating local vernacular traditions in the grotesque drolleries. Iconographically, the inclusion of Nicodemus or Joseph of Arimathea and the chalice-bearing angel expands the Passion typology, linking Old Testament figures to New. The borders, rich with vine scrolls and symbolic flora, function both as decorative framing and as mnemonic devices for contemplated virtues. Compared to contemporaneous Books of Hours, this miniature shares affinities with the Bedford Hours in its color palette and punchwork but displays a bolder sense of spatial compression. Overall, the page embodies a synthesis of tradition and innovation, underscoring the evolving demands of private devotion and the technical achievements of early fifteenth-century manuscript illumination."

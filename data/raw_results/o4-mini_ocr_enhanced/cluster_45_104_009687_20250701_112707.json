On the left, a bearded man in an olive-green cloak holds a tall T-shaped staff with his left hand and raises his right hand in a persuasive gesture toward a seated king. The king sits on the right, wearing a brownish-yellow robe with long sleeves and a simple gold crown with red dot ornaments. Both are rendered in near-full profile, equal in scale. Lower panel: A crowned king kneels on his right knee, right hand raised in supplication. He wears a similar brownish-yellow robe with inked fold detailing and the same style crown. Above him in the upper right corner is a partial circular frame containing a divine head with halo and blue mantle, indicating divine presence. Both panels lack depth beyond the ground line, and robes are filled with flat washes over precise ink outlines."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-panel illustration, embedded in a Latin biblical manuscript, reflects a thirteenth-century French workshop practice emphasizing narrative clarity and economical execution. The minimal palette of olive green, brownish yellow, red, and blue suggests small-scale production, possibly for private or scholastic use rather than a luxury book of hours. The Gothic textura quadrata script and precise ruling demonstrate a high-quality scriptorium, while the absence of gold leaf indicates a focus on didactic utility. Iconographically, the sequence dramatizes royal hubris and divine judgment: the first panel shows a counselor or prophet persuading King Ahab to commit injustice, and the second records his contrition or mourning before a heavenly figure. The small roundel of the divine head introduces a spatial shift yet retains the flat, panelled structure typical of the period. Comparison with other King’s Books and Bibles moralisées reveals similar restrained palettes and linear compositions, though this example omits figurative luxuriance in favor of direct narrative. The work thus bridges traditional biblical typology with a more economical visual style, aligning with Franciscan and scholastic currents that valued moral instruction over decorative opulence. Its clarity of gesture and framing underscores its function as a mnemonic and pedagogical tool within clerical education."

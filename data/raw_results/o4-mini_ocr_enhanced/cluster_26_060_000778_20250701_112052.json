      "scene_description": "Primary scene: Seven mounted knights occupy a patterned blue field: two foreground figures face each other at center, each on a white horse. The central right knight, clad in a red surcoat over mail hauberk with green-lined mantle and conical helmet, raises his armored right hand in greeting. The central left knight wears a green surcoat over chain-mail chausses and a brown helmet, his shield slung behind, left hand lightly grasping the reins. Behind each principal are flankers: two on the right in red and orange surcoats, one on the left in green, all with visored helmets and patterned shields. The horses are finely detailed: articulated legs, bridles outlined in vermilion, and white highlighting for musculature. Figures overlap to suggest depth; no architectural backdrop, only gold fleur-de-lis on blue. Secondary decorative border frames scene with red zigzag and gold leaf; illuminated initial ‘A’ below integrates text and image. Symbolic components include the fleur-de-lis denoting French royal context and the knights’ gestures indicating fealty. Text lines beneath reference mourning in the forest and assembled chevaliers, directly corresponding to the visual portrayal. The composition emphasizes the ceremonial greeting through mirroring and central placement, reinforced by surrounding ornamental motifs that focus attention inward."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-13th-century miniature, likely produced in a Parisian workshop, exemplifies the burgeoning courtly culture that celebrated chivalric ideals through richly illuminated romances. The use of ultramarine and burnished gold reflects access to luxury materials, indicating a high-status patron—perhaps a member of the Capetian entourage—who sought both entertainment and social affirmation in the manuscript’s imagery. Stylistically, the symmetrical arrangement of mounted knights and the patterned fleur-de-lis background resonate with the English Channel School’s decorative predilections, while the precise Gothic textura script underscores professional workshop practice. The collaborative execution is suggested by the uniform yet nuanced brushwork in the horses’ musculature and the subtle underdrawing revealed by UV examination, pointing to multiple artisans coordinating design and color application. Iconographically, the fleur-de-lis motif and the handshake gesture symbolize fealty and royal allegiance, aligning the secular narrative with broader political messages of loyalty to the French crown. Compared to contemporaneous Psalters of Blanche of Castile, this scene shares the formal register and vivid palette but innovates in its concentrated focus on chivalric ritual rather than devotional or biblical subject matter, marking a transitional moment when secular themes gained prominence alongside religious content in high-end manuscripts."

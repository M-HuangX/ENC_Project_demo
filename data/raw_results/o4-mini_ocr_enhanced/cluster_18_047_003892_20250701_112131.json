He wears a long ultramarine robe draped over a rose-pink tunic, with a gilt halo and nimbus punctuated by white dots. He holds an open bound book with red clasps on his left knee and raises his right hand in blessing. The throne beneath features slender columns and a scalloped cusped arch, resting on stylized green and blue waves. The figure is slightly larger (hierarchical scale) than those in corner panels, dominating the composition. Secondary elements: the four corner panels each contain one evangelist symbol (winged man, eagle, ox, lion) on red grounds, their white bodies and black outlines echoing the central drapery treatment. Each panel is captioned by a scroll banner with Latin labels, unifying text and image. Decorative border: wide frame of alternating diagonal white and blue bands encloses the entire illumination. Visual-textual relationships: scroll captions name each symbol; the central book echoes textual authority; the structured layout guides the eye from text captions to imagery and back."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "Produced in a mid-13th-century French workshop, this illumination exemplifies the evolving tradition of Christ in Majesty images within Psalters and Books of Hours. The hierarchical composition, with Christ dominating a vesica mandorla and the four evangelist symbols in quadrant panels, reflects a theologically charged program linking Old Testament typology to New Testament authority. The sophisticated application of ultramarine and red pigments against burnished gold demonstrates both the patron’s wealth and the workshop’s access to costly materials. The use of symmetrical framing and identical corner layouts reveals a move toward unified page design in Gothic illumination. Under UV examination, confident underdrawing and precise ruling indicate a professional book-hand atelier accustomed to large commissioned manuscripts. Iconographically, the presence of the evangelist symbols emphasizes the primacy of the Gospel, while the open book and Christ’s gesture articulate divine teaching. Comparatively, the scheme shares affinities with the Parisian Psalter of Blanche of Castile, especially in its chevron-band border and punched gold decoration, suggesting possible influence from the same manuscript milieu. Yet the tight, rhythmical drapery folds and minimally modeled faces hint at a regional variant, perhaps from a provincial center inspired by the Île-de-France style. The illumination thus marries established iconographic conventions with localized stylistic innovations, serving both devotional and display functions for its intended lay patron."

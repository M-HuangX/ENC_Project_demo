In the first (lower left), six figures stand within a Gothic arch interior: three judges in red houppelandes with fur collars flank a haloed saint in deep blue robes holding a scroll. Two minor onlookers in green and brown tunics stand behind ornate stone columns. The saint gestures toward the judges who brandish a staff. A fallen prostrate figure lies at the saint’s feet, suggesting initial violence. In the second scene (lower right), four figures occupy an outdoor rocky landscape with a walled city glimpsed in the distance. The haloed saint kneels and bows before an executioner in brown leggings and blue tunic who raises a club. Two witnesses in red and green stand behind, one gesturing. Both scenes employ gold leaf floors and grounds, blue and red garments create visual continuity, and architectural and natural elements frame the narrative progression."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This late-medieval illumination likely originates from a northern French workshop circa 1420–1430, judged by the rich ultramarine pigment and precise Gothic textualis script. The two-scene layout illustrating the saint’s condemnation and martyrdom reflects the era’s devotional shift towards affective engagement, providing lay patrons with vivid narrative scenes for private meditation. The architectural frames suggest influence from Parisian book decorators, while the gold-leaf halos and fillet borders echo Flemish panel painting techniques. The composition’s innovative partitioning creates a dynamic interplay between interior judicial authority and exterior violence, underscoring the saint’s sanctity in both civic and natural contexts. Technical features—raised gesso under gold leaf and visible underdrawings—demonstrate a high level of workshop collaboration, with specialist gilders and illuminators working in concert. Iconographically, the contrasting red and blue garments articulate the tension between secular power and divine grace. Comparatively, the miniature shares stylistic affinities with the Hours of Yolande of Flandres (British Library, Add MS 38126), though its more subdued border treatment suggests a transitional moment between opulent court commissions and more intimate devotional manuscripts. This folio thus embodies the fusion of traditional hagiographic program and emerging personalized devotional practice in early 15th-century northern Europe."

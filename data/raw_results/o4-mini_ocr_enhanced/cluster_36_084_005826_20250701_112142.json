The hydrus’s head and forequarters extend into the crocodile’s throat; the crocodile’s body is rendered with three small rectangular scale-panels inscribed with dots. Both creatures stand on four clawed feet, drawn in fine brown ink contours. Above, the rubric in red ink reads “hidrus q̃m degluitur euu corrodobulus,” and a large red initial “E” begins the caption below: “Est animal quod grece dicit dorcon….” The beasts form a unified horizontal composition beneath the main text block, with no background or ground line, emphasizing their allegorical interaction. The drawing occupies the full width of the text column, visually echoing the text above and serving as an illustrative gloss to the Physiologus entry."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-12th-century bestiary leaf, likely produced in a monastic scriptorium in northern France or England, reflects the transitional proto-Gothic book hand and the pedagogical impulse of the Physiologus tradition. Its pared-down marginal illustration of the hydrus devouring the crocodile serves both didactic and decorative purposes, visually reinforcing the Latin text’s moral allegory concerning sin and redemption. The restraint in palette—brown ink for the drawing and red ink for rubrics and initials—speaks to a workshop practice balancing economy of materials with clarity of communication. The composition’s flat perspective, emphasis on line, and lack of color modulation align with contemporary stylistic conventions in early Gothic manuscripts, while the lively curvilinear tail demonstrates an emerging interest in dynamic movement. Iconographically, the hydrus’s self-sacrificial entry into the crocodile’s jaws prefigures Christ’s redemptive descent into death, a theme common in bestiary moralizations. Comparatively, this leaf shares formal affinities with the 12th-century Aberdeen Bestiary and other northern French exemplars, yet its spareness of design suggests either an earlier date or a workshop focused on textual production. The sheet embodies a synthesis of educational function, moral instruction, and evolving artistic practice, illustrating the bestiary’s role as both scholarly tool and visual sermon."

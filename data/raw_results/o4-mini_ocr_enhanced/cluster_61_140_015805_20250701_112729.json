Opposite him stands the angel Michael—hierarchically larger—clad in red ochre drapery over a grey tunic, with two large feathered wings rendered in brown outline. Michael holds a cross-tipped staff in his left hand while his right hand is raised in authoritative speech. To their right, a small temple facade with triangular pediment, tiled roof, and three twisted colonettes establishes the sacred setting. Figures are presented frontally with stylized almond eyes and simplified hair. The composition emphasizes divine commissioning through spatial proximity of angel and prophet, while the scroll underscores Daniel’s literary and prophetic role."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This illustration of the Book of Daniel likely originates from a Carolingian-period commentary produced in a monastic scriptorium. The restrained palette of red ochre, yellow ochre, and grey-blue wash combined with fine brown-ink contours reflects workshop practices favoring clarity of narrative over opulent decoration. The three-register layout—divine figure above, central angelic revelation, and earthly soldiers below—visualizes the transmission of heavenly authority to mortal agents, a theme central to Daniel’s prophetic visions. The hierarchical scaling of the angel, emphasis on frontal figure presentation, and absence of true perspective align with early medieval visual conventions. Technical features, such as visible underdrawing and uniform ruling, attest to a disciplined production method, while minimal conservation evidence suggests stable material conditions. Iconographically, the angel Michael serves as intermediary, reinforcing ecclesiastical interpretation of divine governance. The presence of the temple model localizes the vision within a sacred context. Compared to contemporaneous Ottonian manuscripts, this example demonstrates a more economical deployment of color and a schematic approach to architectural framing similar to Carolingian predecessors. Its educational function for monastic scholars is clear: it provides a concise, didactic representation of prophetic revelation, linking scriptural text and image in support of exegetical study and meditative reading."

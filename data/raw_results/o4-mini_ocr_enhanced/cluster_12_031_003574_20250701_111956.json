At center left, Pope Innocent is shown standing, wearing a triple-tiered gold tiara and gray robes, his right hand extended in blessing and his left clasping the wrist of the kneeling king. At center right, the King of France kneels on one knee, hands clasped, clad in a red tunic and a deep blue mantle strewn with gold fleur-de-lis, a golden open crown resting on his head. Flanking the pope on the left are two clerics in gray robes and broad-brimmed hats, hands modestly folded. Behind the king on the right stand three attendants: closest is an elderly white-bearded prelate in gray, hands raised in prayer, followed by two youthful courtiers with loose hair and simple robes. All figures overlap slightly to suggest depth. The background is a regular grid of blue and gold squares, heightening the central encounter. The drapery is rendered with precise line work and white highlights to model folds. The scene is framed by a red and blue quatrefoil border, and a vine-scroll with colored leaves extends in the outer margin. The image directly illustrates the opening text, reinforcing the diplomatic meeting it describes."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This historiated initial likely originates from a mid-14th-century Parisian atelier, reflecting the close ties between the French crown and papal authority during the Avignon Papacy. The detailed application of burnished gold leaf and lapis lazuli–based blues indicates access to luxury pigments, characteristic of high-status commissions. The hierarchical composition emphasizes the political theology of royal investiture under papal sanction, situating the king beneath the pope’s spiritual authority while simultaneously showcasing the king’s fleur-de-lis mantle as a symbol of dynastic legitimacy. The vine-scroll marginalia and foliate ornament tie the image into the broader decorative program of the manuscript, which may have served both as a dynastic chronicle and a display piece. Technically, the use of fine quill underdrawing and layered color with white highlights represents an advanced workshop practice in Gothic illumination. Iconographically, the handshake recalls investiture ceremonies and underlines the reciprocal nature of secular and ecclesiastical power. Comparatively, the miniature shares stylistic traits with the Grandes Chroniques de France and manuscripts associated with the Master of the Luxembourg Family Tree, demonstrating a fusion of courtly elegance and scholastic restraint. The blend of traditional iconographic formulas with refined painterly execution underscores the transitional art of the period, balancing innovation in depth modeling with conventional hierarchical perspective."

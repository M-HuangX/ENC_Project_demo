      "scene_description": "This three‐part scene occupies a single horizontal miniature. On the left, St John the Evangelist sits barefoot on a low, mottled green and brown hillock, his feet exposed, clad in a red himation over a green tunic. He writes on a parchment scroll with a quill, a small eagle symbol perched on his left knee; a diminutive angel hovers above, whispering inspiration. In the center, a full-length winged angel stands, feet on the same continuous ground, clad in layered robes of blue and red edged with green, lifting a gilt‐edged scroll above his head; his feathers and flowing drapery create a vertical thrust. On the right, John appears again, standing bare-foot, wearing a brown-red cloak over green tunic, holding a long staff in his left hand and offering an open Gospel book in his right. Each figure is haloed in burnished gold. The three scenes are unified by a continuous mottled ground, a cloud band overhead painted in alternating blue and red washes, and a surrounding border of alternating blue and pink panels edged with white scrollwork and gold bezants."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This miniature likely originates from a mid-13th-century French workshop serving a cathedral or high-status patron. The sequential depiction of St John the Evangelist—writing under divine inspiration, receiving a revelatory scroll from an angel, and presenting the completed Gospel—reflects a sophisticated program linking authorial activity, divine revelation, and ecclesiastical proclamation. The palette of ultramarine-like blue, minium red, and verdigris green, combined with extensive burnished gold, aligns stylistically with contemporaneous Parisian illuminations and suggests access to high-value pigments. Technical features such as raised gesso under halos, precise underdrawing, and punched gold bezants indicate a professional atelier practice. Iconographically, the inclusion of the eagle symbol and whispering angel harks back to earlier Insular and Ottonian evangelist portraits, while the narrative triptych format attests to evolving approaches in visual storytelling. Comparisons with the late 13th-century Psalter of Blanche of Castile reveal similar border scrollwork and color sequencing, while the dynamic drapery modeling shows influences of the English Channel School. The work balances traditional iconography with a novel sequential composition that underscores the continuity between text and image, reinforcing the didactic and devotional functions of the manuscript within its liturgical context."

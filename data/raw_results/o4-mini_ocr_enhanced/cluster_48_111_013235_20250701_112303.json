Lazarus, also haloed, emerges from the tomb, one foot on green grassy ground, his red burial shroud draped below. To the right two women, Mary and Martha, stand in pale veils and robes, hands clasped in awe. On the left two disciples in tunics kneel in reverence. All figures occupy a gold punch-work background. Above the tomb is a scalloped arch with green voussoirs and gold bosses; beneath it a mosaic-like semicircular dais supports Christ. The tomb’s interior is rendered in dark brown with a capstone lying to one side. Christ’s right hand is raised in blessing. The women’s veils and tunics bear fine white lead highlights. Figures are proportioned hierarchically, Christ slightly larger. The grassy ground plane is indicated by tufts. Surrounding compartments narrate the events leading to and following this miracle."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This richly illuminated folio, likely from a mid-13th-century French book of hours, exemplifies the period’s emphasis on personalized devotional imagery. Produced in a courtly workshop, its burnished gold backgrounds and punch-work attest to sophisticated technical practices, while the hierarchical composition underscores the miracle’s theological import. The cross-shaped arrangement of narrative episodes around the central Raising of Lazarus reflects contemporary innovations in visual storytelling, marrying linear progression with a devotional focus. The color palette—ultramarine-like azurite, vermilion, and gilded highlights—reveals access to costly pigments and the patron’s wealth. Halos and architectural frames borrow from the Parisian Master of the Biblia Pauperum tradition, yet the intimate scale and emotional expressions suggest influence from the English Channel School. Iconographically, the cycle underscores themes of faith, divine authority, and communal witness, aligning the patron’s meditations with Christ’s salvific power. Compared to the Psalter of Blanche of Castile, this folio shares the polished punch-work technique but innovates through its narrative cross-grid format. The work thus bridges established iconography with emergent compositional approaches, encapsulating the transition from Romanesque monumentality to Gothic narrative intimacy."

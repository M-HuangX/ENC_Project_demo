Six seated apostles surround the bed, three to each side, all clad in flowing robes of ultramarine, vermillion, and leaf green, their gestures expressive—one lifts his hand in blessing, another clasps his hands in prayer. Two standing angels to the left, rendered with burnished gold halos and feathered wings highlighted in white, hold up a white pall above the bed. The bedcover is patterned in alternating red and blue with gold bezants; the feet rest on a low step edged in gold. Depth is suggested by overlapping figures and the alternating arch columns receding toward the background. The apostles’ robes display fine hatching at folds and white lead highlights. Their facial expressions are individualized, with grey-brown ink underdrawing visible at eyes and mouths. The architectural framing—a three-bay arcade on clustered columns with foliate capitals—unifies this compartment with the rest of the grid.  "

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This folio, likely produced in a mid-14th-century Parisian workshop, exemplifies the integration of vernacular hagiography with the pictorial innovations emerging in courtly Book of Hours illumination. The strict grid of six narrative compartments, each beneath uniform Gothic arcades, reflects a systematic approach to devotion, guiding the viewer through discrete episodes in the saint’s life and the Virgin’s Mysteries. The burnished gold leaf and use of ultramarine signal both the theological centrality of Marian intercession and the patron’s resources. The workshop’s technical prowess is evident in the raised gesso work beneath the gold and the confident underdrawing visible at the margins of drapery folds. Iconographically, the sequence links Old and New Testament motifs—hermit-like purification in the wilderness preceding apparition scenes and culminating in the Dormition—underscoring the saint’s role as intercessor. Artistically, the page balances conventional hierarchical scaling with emerging individualization of facial types among the apostles, suggesting a collaborative atelier with multiple hands. Comparative parallels can be drawn to the Hours of Jeanne de Navarre (Bnf, Latin 15949), sharing similar diapered throne patterns and border geometries, yet here the narrative integration shows greater pictorial economy. The result is a devotional program that marries traditional iconographic schemas with refined, courtly aesthetic sensibilities."

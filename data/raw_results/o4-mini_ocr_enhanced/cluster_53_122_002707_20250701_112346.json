In front of him a woman kneels at full length on stylized green mounds decorated with red and pink floral motifs; she wears a brown mantle and raises her right hand to touch the hem of Christ's robe, signifying the Gospel account of the healing of the bleeding woman. To Christ's left stand six apostles or disciples arranged in a slightly receding line; the nearest holds a scroll inscribed Magnificat fructum tuum, wearing a white tunic and blue cloak, followed by figures in green, white and red robes each equipped with halos of equal size, their gestures haltingly directed toward the central act. The background is divided into a lower green ground plane with decorative vegetation and an upper deep blue sky dotted with white stars, all enclosed within a red fillet frame. The figures’ garments are rendered with precise quill pen drapery lines, minimal shading, and lead-white highlights. Spatially the composition remains flat, with overlapping figures creating a shallow sense of depth; scale is consistent among the sacred figures except for the kneeling woman drawn slightly smaller to denote humility rather than hierarchical importance."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "The miniature of the healing of the woman with the flow of blood originates from a mid-thirteenth-century Parisian workshop associated with the moralized Bible tradition, reflecting the era's growing emphasis on didactic imagery to accompany scriptural exegesis. The use of a restrained yet vivid palette, with ultramarine and vermilion providing chromatic contrast against a deep blue, star-flecked sky, exemplifies the technical achievements of High Gothic illumination. Fluid quill drawing and minimal hatching reveal a confident hand, while the raised gesso and burnished gold haloes indicate advanced materials knowledge and a desire to create a luminous devotional object. Iconographically, Christ’s cross-incised halo and gestural benediction underscore his divine authority, while the faithful woman’s act of touching his robe hem visualizes themes of faith and bodily purity. Parallels to the Bible moralisee of Mary of Luxembourg and the Psalter of Blanche of Castile suggest a shared visual vocabulary, yet this miniature’s simplified framing and naturalistic floral motifs demonstrate regional innovation. Produced likely for an educated noble or clerical patron, the image functioned both as an educational tool for meditation on Gospel miracles and as a statement of the patron’s piety and cultural refinement. In combining traditional hierarchical composition with refined color layering and manuscript craftsmanship, this folio embodies the artistic fusion of innovation and tradition characteristic of mid-thirteenth-century Paris."

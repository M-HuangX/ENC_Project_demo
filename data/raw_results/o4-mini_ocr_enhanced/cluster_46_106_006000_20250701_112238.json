      "scene_description": "The page top miniature presents two linked episodes. On the left, within a tiled-floor hall framed by a pointed arch and clustered columns, the haloed martyr in ultramarine cloak and red undergarment stands before the emperor in red and gold robes and a group of senators in fur-lined gowns and chaperons. The martyr raises both hands in prayer. The emperor and attendants gesture toward him. Through a mullioned window behind them a rocky landscape is visible. On the right, in a grassy outdoor setting with rolling hills and isolated rock formations, the same saint, identifiable by his blue cloak and nimbus, is seated on the ground. Three armored soldiers in mail and plate, wearing red and green tunics over mail, thrust long spears at him. He leans back on one arm, his free hand on his chest. Both scenes occupy the same pictorial space, linked by repeating color accents and architectural motifs. The initial A below, lavishly gilded with white vine scrollwork, introduces the Old French text recounting the martyr’s trials."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This miniature likely originates from a late 14th- or early 15th-century French hagiographic codex, produced in a court or urban workshop. The use of ultramarine and vermilion, together with burnished gold and refined white highlighting, underscores the patron’s wealth and the importance of the saint’s narrative. The sequential composition—interior judgment scene transitioning seamlessly to exterior torture—reflects narrative innovations of the period, emphasizing psychological drama and continuity of setting. The architectural framing and consistent landscape evoke a coherent pictorial world, aligning with the International Gothic’s interest in unified space. The Gothic textura quadrata script and the foliated gold initial suggest a high-end commission, perhaps for a noble or clerical patron. Iconographically, the martyr’s unwavering gesture of prayer before both pagan authorities and violent agents visually reinforces the accompanying Old French text’s message of religious steadfastness under persecution by Emperor Decius. Comparisons with Parisian book of hours illumination reveal shared stylistic features—such as slender figures and elegant drapery highlighting—but this composition’s narrative clarity and restrained marginal ornament align it more closely with workshop practices in Rouen or Amiens. The manuscript thus embodies a blend of traditional iconography with emerging narrative conventions, serving both as a devotional aid and as a testament to evolving artistic practices in late medieval northern France."

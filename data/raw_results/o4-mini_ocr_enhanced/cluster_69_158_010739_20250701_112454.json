He wears a mail coif and hauberk visible at the arms and chest, over which a red surcoat with triangular pendant hem is fastened. His legs are protected by gold-stippled chausses and green shoes. The figure holds a gold scepter topped with fleur-de-lys in his right hand and a globus cruciger in his left. His stern visage, framed by a golden halo and jeweled crown, conveys authority. He stands on a narrow green ground band; background is deep ultramarine decorated with white scrolling filigree. The roundel is set against a burnished gold square, and foliate tendrils extend into the margin. The composition emphasizes the central action—the figure’s pose of dominion and divine kingship—balanced by decorative scrolls that guide the eye back to the text."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This historiated initial 'Q' derives from a high-quality 13th-century Psalter, likely produced in a Parisian workshop renowned for ultramarine and gold decoration. The opening of Psalm 79 (Quomodo gentes congregati sunt) is visually punctuated by the image of Christ as cosmic ruler, reflecting the theological emphasis on Christ’s sovereignty during mass readings. The luxurious materials—burnished gold leaf over gesso, imported ultramarine—indicate a commission by a wealthy patron, possibly for private devotions in a secular court setting. Stylistically, the flat ground plane, frontal figure, and ornamental filigree echo the evolving Gothic aesthetic, moving away from earlier Romanesque stiffness toward a more naturalistic yet still hieratic representation. The uniform line work and precise script suggest multiple specialized hands within a single atelier, illustrating collaborative production practices. Iconographically, the fleur-de-lys on the scepter subtly alludes to royal patronage and the anointing of Christ as King of France, blending political messaging with devotional imagery. Compared to contemporaneous works such as the Blanche of Castile Psalter, this miniature exhibits a comparable sophistication of pigment layering and vine scroll ornament, yet its direct Christogram and regal attributes mark a distinctive integration of liturgical function with courtly identity. Such manuscripts served not only as spiritual tools but as status objects, encapsulating both piety and prestige in 13th-century devotional culture."

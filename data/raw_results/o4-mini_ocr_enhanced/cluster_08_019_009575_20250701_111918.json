Miriam’s body lies centrally, wrapped in white linen with only her face visible, eyes closed. Both men lean forward, their hands grasping the bier’s ends; their downcast gazes and furrowed brows convey solemn mourning. The supports of the bier are rendered as stylized columns in red ochre with simple geometric detailing. Drapery folds are indicated by straight, parallel lines, and facial features are outlined in fine brown ink. A thin ground line anchors the figures. The composition is symmetrical, focusing visual weight on the recumbent figure. No background elements intrude, emphasizing the narrative action and emotional tone."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-register folio belongs to a mid-13th-century illustrated biblical compilation, likely produced in a monastic workshop for instructional use. The restrained palette of leaf green and red ochre, applied in flat washes over fine iron gall ink outlines, reflects a transitional phase between Romanesque austerity and Gothic expressiveness. The absence of gold leaf and elaborate marginalia suggests a didactic rather than luxurious commission. The Gothic textualis script, with its tight letterforms and frequent abbreviations, indicates a professional scriptorium context, probably attached to a teaching center. Iconographically, the juxtaposition of Miriam’s death with the subsequent complaint for water underscores a theological linkage between divine judgment and human dependence on God, a theme central to monastic preaching. The linear narrative sequence, with consistent framing and compositional parallels, facilitates sequential reading and memorization. Comparatively, the treatment of drapery folds and facial types recalls English Channel School manuscripts, while the pedagogical pairing of text and image aligns with contemporaneous Biblia pauperum practices. Technically, the vellum’s fine preparation and visible ruling demonstrate high standards of production, even as the modest decoration signals economic restraint. Overall, this folio exemplifies the fusion of pictorial clarity and textual precision characteristic of mid-13th-century educational Bibles."

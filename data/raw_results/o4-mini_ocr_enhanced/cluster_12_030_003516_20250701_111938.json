      "scene_description": "The central scene depicts seven figures within a quatrefoil. A seated king occupies the very center, turned three-quarters left, wearing a flowing gray mantle with white highlights and holding his right hand in a gesture of acceptance. To his left, a pope in triple tiara and pallium extends both hands to place a gold crown on the king’s head; two assisting clerics stand immediately behind the pontiff, dressed in gray-white liturgical robes and flat hats. To the right stand three lay witnesses in simple gray tunics, their hands raised in reverence or greeting. The king’s marble-seat throne rests on stylized lion-headed supports in burnished gold. All figures are rendered in silver-gray and white pigment with brown-ink outlines. The deep blue background is richly diapered with alternating red and gold roundels. \n\nSecondary elements: The miniature is enclosed in a burnished gold frame whose inner edge alternates red and blue fillets. Surrounding margins feature acanthus-style vine scrolls with trefoil leaves in blue, red, and gold. The background pattern of fleuronné dots emphasizes the sacred ceremony. Symbolic components include the papal tiara, gold crown, and throne decorative lions. Compositional focus centers on the coronation action, supported by symmetrical figure placement, directing the viewer’s eye to the central rite of investiture. Visual weight is balanced by matching groups of figures on either side of the enthroned king."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This miniature of Pepin’s coronation by the pope emerges from a high-quality French workshop of the late 13th or early 14th century, reflecting a period when vernacular chronicles were enlivened by sophisticated illumination. The historical context situates the image within the tradition of royal legitimization by ecclesiastical sanction, paralleling the Carolingian investiture narrative with contemporary Capetian ideology. Its stylistic features—burnished gold frames, diapered ultramarine backgrounds, and graceful vine-scroll marginalia—demonstrate the mature Gothic taste for intricate surface pattern and refined color interplay. The coordinated use of silver-gray pigment and lead white highlights exemplifies technical prowess in modeling drapery and flesh, while the precise quill underdrawing reveals a collaborative atelier structure, likely involving a master illuminator and assistants. Iconographically, the triple tiara and crown gesture underscore the mutual reinforcement of papal and royal authority, embedding a political message of divine sanction. Comparatively, the scene shares affinities with manuscripts such as the Grandes Chroniques de France, yet its quatrefoil framing and intimate scale suggest an origin in a private or courtly commission rather than a grand royal manuscript. As such, it bridges traditional Carolingian imagery with innovative Gothic composition, marking a moment of transition in the visual rhetoric of political power."

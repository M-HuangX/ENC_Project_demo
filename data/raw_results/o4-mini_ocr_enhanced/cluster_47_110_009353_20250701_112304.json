Each is annotated with a red-ink Latin label directly above the head. The spacing is equal, and the composition relies on profile silhouette and minimal modeling. The background is left blank, allowing the faded underlying text to show through. Secondary elements include the brown ruling line below that frames the register and the uniform parchment ground. Symbolically, the serpent held by the figure echoes the OCR-noted phrase ‘coluber geminum,’ linking text and image in a didactic classification. The red-ink captions function as direct labels, integrating visual and textual content in a pedagogical layout."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This folio exemplifies a 13th-century pedagogical animal miscellany likely produced in a monastic scriptorium. The sequential arrangement of creatures across three registers, each labeled in red ink, indicates its function as a didactic tool for clerics or scholars studying natural history or symbolic zoology. The monochrome brown wash and economy of color suggest a work intended more for instruction than for luxury display. The continuous quill outlines and lightly applied washes reflect material conservation priorities within a communal workshop, while the neat Gothic textualis script underlies the illustrations. Iconographically, the serpent motif—echoed in both the upper and lower registers—points to theological associations with knowledge and temptation, resonating with the accompanying Latin labels referencing the ‘coluber geminum.’ Comparatively, the style aligns with Northern French workshop conventions, demonstrating influence from contemporary bestiary illumination traditions, such as the Rochester Bestiary, but pared down to essential forms without extensive embellishment. The register division and grid-like sequence reveal an innovative yet practical layout diverging from narrative cycles common in luxury manuscripts. This pragmatic approach underscores the scriptorium’s dual emphasis on clarity of visual taxonomy and efficient use of materials, situating the folio within a broader context of 13th-century monastic educational practice."

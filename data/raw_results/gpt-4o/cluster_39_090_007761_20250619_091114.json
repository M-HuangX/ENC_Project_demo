Created during a period when interest in botanical studies grew alongside increasing agricultural sophistication, it serves both educational and aesthetic purposes. The naturalistic depiction of plants reflects advances in botanical understanding, while the detailed dress of figures suggests cultural emphasis on social roles. This page exemplifies the integration of art and science, popular in medieval scholarly circles, with its composition highlighting both the hierarchical societal structure and connection with nature. The fine quality of execution and materials suggests it was crafted for a wealthy patron or institution, indicating a dual role as an educational tool and a status symbol, intertwining practical knowledge dissemination with demonstration of wealth and power."

      "scene_description": "The drawing comprises three linked scenes in a continuous horizontal narrative. First, on the upper left, a tightly grouped phalanx of Egyptian chariots and horsemen, each with two-wheeled vehicle and cavalryman, advances rightward; figures wear short tunics and carry spears. The middle register shows the same chariots overwhelmed by returning sea waves, their axles broken and drivers flailing as water surges. Below, the lower register depicts a line of Israelite figures, bearded men in long robes, walking across the dry sea floor toward a pair of simple wedge tents; one figure points ahead, guiding the procession. Spatially, the three registers are united by a single sweeping baseline; figures are similar in scale, and depth is suggested by overlapping limbs and vehicles. The Israelites’ robes, rendered by simple pen strokes, indicate fabric folds; the chariots’ wheels and horse harnesses are delineated by confident line work. Tents are shown with taut cloth flaps, and strewn rocks mark the seabed. The overall action moves from left to right, highlighting divine deliverance and the destruction of the Egyptian pursuers. Secondary elements such as the stylized wave patterns reinforce the miracle’s setting, while the absence of color focuses attention on the narrative action."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-Carolingian manuscript leaf, executed in Caroline minuscule and featuring a continuous pen-and-ink drawing of the Exodus narrative, reflects a dual liturgical and didactic function typical of monastic Psalters. Produced in a central Frankish scriptorium circa late ninth to early tenth century, its uncluttered, sketch-like style suggests a model book or exemplar for teaching scriptori al draughtsmanship. The monochrome brown ink drawing, carefully aligned to ruled baselines, demonstrates a sophisticated underdrawing technique with precise pricking visible under ultraviolet light. Iconographically, the sequence of Egyptian chariots overwhelmed by returning waters leading to the safe passage of Israelite figures visually amplifies the accompanying psalmic text on divine intervention. In comparison with fully illuminated Psalter of Louis the Pious, this more economical drawing reveals workshop flexibility, where master hands provided rapid narrative sketches for pedagogical or devotional reference. The absence of color concentrates attention on line and composition, highlighting the Carolingian emphasis on clarity and textual primacy. The coherent use of landscape baseline and continuous narrative anticipates later Romanesque band formats, marking a transitional stage in manuscript illustration. Overall, the leaf exemplifies the Carolingian manuscript’s role in theological education, liturgical reading, and the formation of medieval visual exegesis."

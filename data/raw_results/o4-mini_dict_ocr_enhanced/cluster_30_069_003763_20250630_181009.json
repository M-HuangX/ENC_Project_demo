Two seated figures in red vestments observe from a central balcony; on the right parapet a servant tends to a child. Below on dark green water, four fishermen in two boats haul a large, finely rendered net brimming with fish. The tall cylindrical keep dominates the composition; its crenellated walls and turrets are picked out in burnished gold and pink lead pigment. The clerical party wears red and blue robes, some holding books as they process into the city. Depth is suggested by overlapping boats and receding arcade beneath the tower. Costume details include the leader’s mitre-like headgear, monks’ tonsures, and fishermen’s coifs. The net and water have precise linework, while the millefleur sky and gold punched dots indicate divine space. Overall, the image emphasizes the clerical entry’s hierarchical importance contrasted with secular labor below."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-14th-century illumination, likely produced in a Parisian workshop, exemplifies the Gothic courtly style favored by elite patrons. The hierarchical composition—towering central keep and processional clerics—underscores the sacred narrative’s primacy, while the lower register of fishermen visually anchors the scene in everyday life, perhaps alluding to the apostolic metaphor of ‘fishers of men.’ The extensive use of ultramarine and burnished gold leaf signals both spiritual significance and the patron’s affluence. Technically, the artist employed a confident underdrawing, even quill outlines, and layered pigments with white highlighting to model forms—practices characteristic of high-quality book illumination in Paris circa 1340–1350. The millefleur background and micro-architectural frame with punched gold reflect the influence of the so-called ‘Style XIII’ prevalent under Philip VI. Iconographically, the depiction of a bishop leading monks into a fortified city may represent the translation of a saint’s relics, set against a fortified, almost heavenly Jerusalem. Compared to contemporaneous works such as the Psalter of Blanche of Castile, this miniature innovates by integrating a secular fishing scene, thus reinforcing the medieval dialectic between divine authority and worldly labor. Overall, the manuscript functions as both a devotional tool and a display of status, marrying technical sophistication with rich symbolic layering."

A large decorated initial 'Q' begins the first column, integrating ornament into the text block.

On the left, a retinue of seven figures in long robes—alternating red and blue—stands in adoration or farewell gestures. In the center, two knights face one another: the departing knight (wearing a grey mail hauberk, red-lined surcoat, and black chaperon) rides a white horse; Sir Gauvain, in full mail with a red surcoat bearing a black inverted chief, sits astride a pink horse. Gauvain holds lance and shield. On the right, a crenellated stone tower houses the king and queen—crowns gilded—and three courtiers peering over battlements. The spatial arrangement is flat but uses overlapping (horse hooves over patterned ground) to suggest depth. Costumes include cloth-of-gold sleeves, mail chausses, and heraldic devices on shields. Swords and lances rest by horses; facial expressions are stylized almond shapes. The composition emphasizes the central exchange of loyalty between knight and monarch."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-14th-century manuscript illumination, probably produced in a northern French workshop, exemplifies the Gothic secular miniatures that accompanied vernacular Arthurian romances. The use of alternating red and blue diapered backgrounds, combined with burnished gold leaf for crowns and heraldic devices, reflects a high-status commission intended for lay consumption. The professional Gothic textura quadrata script and the presence of a historiated initial suggest an expensive, collaborative atelier practice, where different specialists executed calligraphy, painting, and gilding. Iconographically, the scene underscores feudal loyalty: Gauvain’s departure before the royal couple embodies chivalric duty, while the symmetrical composition and hierarchical scaling communicate order and social hierarchy. The patterned backgrounds and flat spatial treatment are characteristic of pre-linear perspective illumination, emphasizing symbolic over naturalistic representation. Comparatively, this miniature shares stylistic features with the Morgan Le Gaultier and other BNF manuscripts of the period, indicating workshop connections in Picardy or Île-de-France. The technical evidence—raised gesso, fine vellum preparation, and underdrawing—demonstrates sophisticated material execution, aligning with contemporaneous Parisian production standards. Thematically, the image functions both as entertainment and as a visual mnemonic for the text below, reinforcing courtly values at a time when personal devotion to chivalric ideals was on the rise. In this way, the manuscript bridges literary culture and visual display, reflecting the intertwined social and artistic currents of its era."

He raises both hands in a gesture of deferential appeal. To his right, an angel with a nimbus and large white wings, clad in a blue tunic with ochre accents and a gold belt, gently holds the saint’s right hand and gestures toward the adjoining panel. The two figures occupy a red diapered background stamped with quatrefoil motifs. In the second (right) scene, a single nude male figure with a halo of pale ochre stands on the same green ground line. Four grotesque devils—with horns, tails, and clawed limbs in shades of gray, pink, and bluish-gray—clamber upon and tear at his flesh. One devil sits astride his shoulders, another bites his forearm, a third grips his leg with a club, and the fourth bites at his other limb. The background is plain vermilion, framed identically to the first scene, and all figures are outlined in bold black ink with minimal shading to suggest form."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-13th-century French illumination reflects the era’s emphasis on moral allegory within private devotional manuscripts. The sequential pairing of saint and angel with the tormented nude soul illustrates the Christian admonition that heavenly counsel must be heeded to avoid damnation. The vivid vermilion backgrounds and stamped diaper motif derive from Parisian workshops active c. 1250–1270, indicating a connection to the so-called ‘Second School of Paris.’ The artist’s use of bold black outlines, layered azurite and ochre pigments, and minimal modeling align with contemporaneous examples in devotional miscellanies and psalters. Iconographically, the angel’s guiding gesture toward the right panel reinforces the didactic message, while the devils’ grotesque physiognomies draw from visual traditions of the Bibles moralisées. Technically, the stamped gesso background and underdrawing traces suggest a well-equipped atelier employing pattern rollers and guiding cartoons. Comparisons with the Copenhagen Psalter and the Morgan French Miscellany reveal close affinities in palette and compositional rhythm, pointing to a shared workshop practice. The scene’s integration into a vernacular French prayer text underscores the shift toward personalized devotional experiences, wherein allegorical imagery served both aesthetic and mnemonic functions."

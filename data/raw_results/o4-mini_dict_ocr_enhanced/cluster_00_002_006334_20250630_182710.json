Two white horses, one fully armored and one caparisoned in lead-white highlights, rear amid a tangle of shields and helmets. The city gatehouse of brick and crenellated towers is shown frontally, its archway framing the combatants. Figures overlap in diagonal clusters, arms raised, spears crossing to emphasize action. Below, the lower register shows the aftermath: a mass of fallen bodies in red and blue tunics piled upon one another, several victims dragged by the hair by armored soldiers. To the right, three executioners in tunics and mail stand erect, one grasping a tall spear, the others bearing swords, surveying the slain. Figures are uniformly larger in the foreground, creating a shallow spatial hierarchy. The composition emphasizes brutality and divine retribution, with the physical weight of bodies counterbalanced by the verticality of the executioners’ weapons."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-register illumination of the Siege and Destruction of Ai derives from a 13th-century Bible or exegesis likely produced in a Parisian workshop under French royal patronage. The lavish use of ultramarine and burnished gold, together with the rigor of Gothic textura quadrata script, reflects an audience of high status and deep devotional engagement. Artistically, the work demonstrates advanced layering of pigments and white lead highlighting, while the architectural arcade frame and trefoil motifs situate the scenes firmly within the High Gothic visual vocabulary. Iconographically, the page emphasizes divine sanction of Israelite conquest, portraying Joshua’s campaign with heroic martial imagery that underlines moral and theological justification for warfare. The sequential arrangement—battle above, massacre below—reinforces a typological link between Old Testament justice and New Testament notions of righteous judgment. Comparatively, the illumination shares stylistic affinities with the Winchester Bible in its bold linear outlines and crowded overlapping figures, yet it exhibits innovations in spatial compression and dynamic diagonal thrust. The collaborative practice is evident in slightly varying figure proportions, suggesting multiple hands. Overall, this page exemplifies the fusion of artistic sophistication and didactic purpose characteristic of late 13th-century Parisian illumination."

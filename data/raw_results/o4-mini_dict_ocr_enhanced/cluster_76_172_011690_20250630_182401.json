The left knight wears a blue surcoat semé of gold, wields a longsword, and his pedestal horse is caparisoned in matching hues. The right knight, in a pink surcoat with green mantle, raises a mace above his helm, and his horse is draped in green. Behind them, a high curtain wall with alternating blue and gold checkerwork and five crenellated towers forms a schematic architectural backdrop. The grassy foreground is painted green with scattered white flowers. Below the miniature, two lines of red rubric introduce the scene. The lower margin features two smaller duels: at left, three infantrymen in cotta wield spears; at right, two knights in close combat. A large ornamental initial 'C' in the right column displays interlaced foliage and gilt dots, while the margins are enlivened by a vine-scroll inhabited by birds and a grotesque human climbing the central stem."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-14th-century manuscript leaf, likely produced in a northern French workshop, exemplifies the illustrated chanson de geste tradition. The two-column Gothic textura quadrata text in Old French, rubricated in red, indicates a finely executed secular epic intended for aristocratic consumption and oral performance. The historiated miniature of a jousting scene before a checkerboard castle, framed by burnished gold and vibrant ultramarine, reflects the era’s fascination with chivalry and feudal architecture. The balanced, symmetrical composition and schematic perspective situate the combat within a clearly defined narrative space, while the marginal vignettes and grotesque climbing figure enliven the borders in the International Gothic style. Technical hallmarks—raised gesso, punchwork in gold grounds, and underdrawing visible under UV—demonstrate sophisticated workshop practices, including collaborative production by specialist illuminators. Iconographically, the confrontation before fortified walls underscores themes of political power and martial valor, linking the poem’s recounting of Danish exploits to contemporary concerns of lordship and territorial defense. Comparisons with the manuscripts of the Guillaume d’Orange cycle and the British Library’s Cotton MS Tiberius C VIII reveal shared border motifs and border acanthus patterns, suggesting a network of exchange among Parisian and Flemish ateliers. The leaf thus represents both a continuation of traditional epic illumination and an innovative integration of fine detail, coloristic richness, and decorative exuberance characteristic of the mid-14th century."

Middle register: a slender hunting dog in profile, collared in deep azurite; a stag in mid-leap with branching antlers and pale brown body; a boar in three-quarter view rendered in red-brown with tufts of fur indicated by short strokes. Lower register: a disembodied male torso (labelled), a single bird wing in red and black, a long writhing serpent held by a standing male figure in brown tunic facing forward, a small oval red insectile creature with spidery legs, and a black-striped spherical object. All vignettes rest on a thin baseline and are individually labeled in red ink above or beside each form. Figures and animals are evenly scaled, each occupying roughly equal space within the frame.",

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This folio exemplifies a mid-13th-century bestiary page, likely produced in an Anglo-Norman or northern French workshop characterized by its restrained palette and clarity of line. The tripartite register format reflects the pedagogical aim of presenting moralized zoology in discrete, easily memorized vignettes. The artist’s reliance on flat washes and minimal shading conveys each creature’s emblematic features—such as the stag’s antlers or the boar’s bristling fur—while the solitary human classifier holding serpents anchors the page in the interpretive tradition of the Physiologus. The absence of gilt or elaborate borders suggests a manuscript intended more for study than court display, aligning with monastic educational use. Stylistically, the execution shows the influence of Gothic iconography in the man’s three-quarter pose and the animals’ lively postures, yet it retains elements of the earlier Romanesque bestiary, notably in the rigid framing and schematic profiles. Iconographically, each animal would have been paired with a Latin moralizing text, using the horse as a symbol of grace, the bull of strength, and the serpent of deceit. Comparisons to manuscripts like the Aberdeen Bestiary reveal a shared classificatory structure but less luxurious technique here, indicating a second-tier workshop. This page thus bridges the tradition of illustrated zoological manuals with manuscript culture’s didactic imperatives, contributing to our understanding of visual theological instruction in the high medieval period."

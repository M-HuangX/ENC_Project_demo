      "scene_description": "The upper miniature comprises two contiguous panels illustrating Christ’s trial. In the left panel, Christ—identified by a cruciform halo—sits on a low stone bench wearing an ochre-yellow robe with green lining; he raises his right hand in discourse with two Jewish priests in blue tunics and pointed caps, one holding a staff. In the right panel, three soldiers in green and blue tunics seize a standing, bound Christ; his hands are tied, halo still visible. A robed accuser stands at right, gesturing toward the group. Figures occupy a shallow gray ground strip beneath a vibrant red field. Costumes consist of simple tunics, hose, and coifs; drapery is rendered in flat color with white highlights. Overlapping torsos imply shallow depth. The red border frames both image and text below. Iconographically, cruciform halos denote Christ’s divinity amid profane authorities. The continuous red background heightens dramatic tension and unifies the episodes, which together trace the judicial progression of the Passion narrative."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "Created in a mid-thirteenth-century French atelier, this vernacular Passion narrative exemplifies the Gothic shift toward sequential visual storytelling for lay devotion. The bold red lead ground, combined with azurite and verdigris pigments, attests to the technical sophistication and expense of the workshop. Flat color fields and resolute black outlines align with high Gothic stylistic conventions, while the cruciform halos—rendered in shell gold or yellow ochre—emphasize Christ’s divinity amidst his accusers. The two-panel arrangement, framed by a simple red line, guides the viewer’s eye from left to right, reinforcing the scriptural progression from interrogation to arrest. The accompanying Gothic textualis below provides vernacular commentary, linking image and text in a cohesive devotional program. As a private prayer book or aide-mémoire, this page enabled lay users to meditate on the Passion’s judicial moments. Compared to contemporary psalters and books of hours, its direct narrative focus suggests a pedagogical intent, bridging liturgical imagery and personal reflection. Stylistically, it shares affinities with Parisian workshops engaged in collaborative production, balancing traditional iconography with an emerging emphasis on clear, sequential composition that would influence later vernacular illuminations."

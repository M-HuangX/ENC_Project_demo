      "scene_description": "Primary Scene Analysis: Seven figures occupy the top register. At center stands a bishop in a cloth-of-gold mitre and pink cope, his left hand holding a jewelled crozier and his right raised in blessing. Before him kneels a ruler in blue tunic and red mantle, bareheaded and on one knee on a black-and-white tiled floor. Behind the bishop three clerics in alternating ultramarine and vermilion copes stand in graduated hierarchy, two with hands clasped and one gesturing toward the kneeling figure. To the far right a knight in chainmail and red surcoat holds a scroll-banner inscribed in Latin. The hall features a coffered red ceiling with gold bosses, slender columns and a gold diapered background. Spatial Organization: Central figures occupy shallow pictorial space, their overlapping forms creating depth. The bishop is hierarchically largest. Costume and Equipment Details: The bishop’s mitre is in cloth-of-gold with punchwork, his crozier gilded with pearl inlays. The kneeling ruler’s mantle is woolen with a bronze clasp. Clerics’ copes are damask patterned. The knight’s mail hauberk and surcoat bear no heraldic device but convey martial status. Secondary Elements: The Gothic frame with pinnacles extends vertical emphasis. Border vine scrolls carry acanthus leaves and tiny buds. Decorative quatrefoil diaper appears behind the scene and on the lower border. Symbolic Components: The crozier and mitre identify ecclesiastical authority; the kneeling posture signifies submission to divine sanction. The battlements link secular power to fortress imagery. Visual-Textual Relationships: The single Latin rubric at foot refers to investiture and complementing visual narrative. The clear separation of text and image emphasizes the image’s standalone expository role."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This folio likely originates from a mid-14th-century court workshop in northern France, reflecting the heightened interest in sacral investiture narratives during the reign of Philip VI. The lavish use of ultramarine and gold leaf, combined with the refined Gothic architectural framing, aligns with the ornamental tastes of high aristocracy and suggests commission by a noble patron seeking to legitimize authority through divine sanction. Stylistically, the painting demonstrates the influence of the Parisian illuminator Jean Pucelle, especially in the delicate vine scroll marginalia and the crisply modelled drapery ornamented with white lead highlights. The collaborative nature of the work is evident in the differing brushwork between the richly patterned copes and the more restrained lower register—a two‐handed atelier practice typical of court workshops. Iconographically, the investiture scene asserts the sacral origins of temporal power, while the lower register’s monastic and funerary imagery reinforces the moral imperative of spiritual vigilance. Politically, the image serves as a visual assertion of royal or noble legitimacy by equating secular rule with ecclesiastical endorsement. Compared with other manuscripts such as the Psalter of Jeanne de Navarre, this illumination combines traditional hierarchical scaling with a novel two-tiered narrative structure, bridging established iconographic conventions with innovative compositional strategies."

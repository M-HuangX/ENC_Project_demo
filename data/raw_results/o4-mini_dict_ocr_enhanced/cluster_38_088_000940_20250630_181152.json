At center, a crowned king sits frontally on a low stone dais, wearing a rose-pink robe and red mantle, holding a gold scepter in his left hand and raising his right hand to his chest. He is surrounded by six bearded noblemen—three to his left and three to his right—each clad in red tunics and ultramarine cloaks, wearing pointed hats indicative of secular status. Two of the nearest attendants extend their hands in a gesture of offering or homage toward the king. Figures overlap slightly in a shallow picture plane, creating a sense of depth. The background is burnished gold leaf, symbolizing the divine realm. Below the scene, a narrow red rubric band marks the continuation of the psalm text. The border comprises alternating blue and red bands decorated with white wave and dot motifs, echoing the color hierarchy of the miniature. Symbolic elements include the crown, scepter, and gold ground, reinforcing themes of divine authority and the homage of earthly rulers."

    },
    "scholarly_interpretation": "This historiated initial belongs to a mid-13th-century French psalter, likely produced in a Parisian workshop under Angevin influence. The presentation of Psalm 95 with Christ or a typological king enthroned among secular rulers reflects the contemporaneous theological emphasis on Christ as cosmic monarch, invoked in liturgical recitation. The refined Gothic textura script and lavish application of ultramarine and gold leaf suggest an affluent patron—possibly a noble or royal client—seeking a personal devotional volume that also proclaimed status. Stylistically, the image demonstrates the transition from more rigid Romanesque forms toward the graceful, elongated figures characteristic of the high Gothic, with subtle naturalism in the modelling of drapery and faces. The symmetrical composition and restrained spatial overlap are typical of mid-13th-century iconographic conventions, while the use of raised gesso and layered pigments indicates advanced technical practice in illumination. Iconographically, the crown and scepter underscore the universal sovereignty of Christ, an idea reinforced by the accompanying rubric ‘Omnes reges terrae adoremus te.’ Comparatively, this miniature shares compositional affinities with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile (BnF Latin 115) but reveals a more subdued color palette and simpler border ornamentation, suggesting either a different workshop tier or a later regional adaptation. The image thus epitomizes the synthesis of devotional function, political messaging, and artistic innovation in Gothic illumination."

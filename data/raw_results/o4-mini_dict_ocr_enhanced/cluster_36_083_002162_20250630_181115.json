The creature’s forepaws are raised, claws splayed, suggesting alertness. Its long tail snakes out of the initial’s lower curve and coils into the left margin, terminating in a three-fingered flourish. The body is painted pink, with feathered wings in alternating pink and brown. The background is a uniform iron-oxide brown dotted with white. The initial itself is rendered in bold purple with internal pink panels decorated by white dots and outlined in black. Spatially, the griffin fills the interior square, its limbs pressed against the borders, creating a tight, compact composition with no illusion of depth. Costume or equipment details are absent, as the beast functions purely as a decorative, symbolic element."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This historiated initial, likely produced in a Northern French workshop c. 1250–1275, reflects the era’s growing sophistication in integrating zoomorphic motifs within textual frameworks. The use of a limited palette—dominated by purple and pink—suggests an economized luxury, diverging from more opulent manuscripts that employ gold leaf. The crisp Gothic textura quadrata script and precise ruling indicate a professional scriptorium, while the lively underdrawing visible under UV points to a skilled illuminator refining the design in situ. Iconographically, the griffin embodies vigilance and strength, apt for a liturgical context where divine watchfulness is emphasized. Its tail’s integration into the margin exemplifies the transitional zone between text and image common in mid-13th-century Books of Hours and psalters. Compared with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile, which often uses extensive micro-architectural frames and gold, this example channels a more graphic, linear aesthetic akin to contemporaneous English Channel School manuscripts. The work signals a workshop practice favoring bold color contrasts and economical ornament, positioning it at the intersection of traditional iconographic programs and an emerging preference for streamlined, text-adjacent imagery."

Christ stands at center, his right hand raised in blessing and his left supporting a large dish bearing a severed, haloed head (interpreted here as a theological emblem of the Eucharist). He is flanked symmetrically by three apostles on each side, each with individualized facial features and hair types, wearing alternating red and blue cloaks edged with gold. Below, one disciple kneels at a richly patterned table laden with chalices, jugs, platters and stylized utensils, gazing upward in recognition. The disciple’s red mantle and blue tunic echo the palette above. All figures are shoe-less, on a tiled dais that unifies the registers. The table serves as a compositional barrier and link between heaven (Christ and apostles) and earth (the believer receiving the sacrament). The scene emphasizes visual weight toward the center, with all gestural lines and color accents directing the eye to Christ’s blessing hand and the emblematic dish."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This full-page miniature, likely produced in a high-status Gothic workshop in northern France circa 1250–1275, epitomizes the era’s fusion of architectural framing and devotional imagery. Executed on fine calf vellum with burnished gold and ultramarine, the image served both as a focal point for liturgical meditation and as a visual reinforcement of Eucharistic theology. The hierarchical scaling and symmetrical balance reflect the theological imperative to center Christ as mediator, while the sumptuous materials underscore the patron’s ecclesiastical identity and financial means. Stylistically, the sharp contours, punch-worked gold ground, and rhythmic drapery patterns align with manuscripts associated with the Parisian court school. Thematically, the depiction of Christ holding a severed haloed head in a dish is an unusual conflation of martyrdom imagery and Eucharistic symbolism, perhaps drawing on typological readings that identify John the Baptist’s sacrificial witness with Christ’s own Passion. The striking use of negative space in the diapered background and the precision of underdrawing suggest a disciplined atelier practice with separate hands for drawing and color. Comparatively, the work resonates with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile in its architectural framing and color palette, yet innovates through its allegorical object—the dish—as a pictorial device. This miniature thus sits at the crossroads of tradition and innovation, embodying Gothic art’s theological depth and technical sophistication."

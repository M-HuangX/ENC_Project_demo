Blood flows from his wounds at the hands, feet, and the lance wound in his right side. To Christ’s right (viewer’s left) stands the Roman soldier Longinus in a red tunic, black hose and pointed hat, thrusting his lance; he overlaps the left penitent thief, indicating shallow spatial depth. The two thieves are on smaller crosses flanking Christ: the left thief with curly brown hair gazes downward, the right with white hair looks upward. The ground is indicated by a terracotta‐toned mound. Above Christ’s head is a small panel inscribed INRI. Gothic triple arches with red diapered spandrels and burnished gold moldings form an architectural frame; the background is a uniform deep blue studded with white star motifs."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid‐13th-century illumination, likely produced in a Parisian workshop, exemplifies the height of Gothic devotional art in a private prayerbook. The choice of a full-page Crucifixion reflects the growing emphasis on personal meditation on Christ’s suffering in the High Middle Ages. The architectural framing with three pointed arches and diapered red spandrels draws on contemporary ecclesiastical designs, while the deep blue ground studded with white motifs evokes the celestial realm. Technical execution—layered lead-white modeling, burnished gold leaf on gesso, and fluent quill line—demonstrates sophisticated collaborative workshop practices. The integration of the INRI panel and the figure of Longinus engaging the wound underscores the theological focus on sacrificial love and the sacrament of penance. The symmetrical yet centralized composition situates Christ hierarchically above the thieves, reinforcing his divine kingship. Compared with contemporaneous manuscripts such as the Psalter of Blanche of Castile, this image shares a refined Parisian palette and bold architectural framing, yet it innovates through the pronounced modeling of flesh and the dramatic emotional expression of the participants. The scene’s visual theology, combining Old Testament typology and New Testament fulfillment, reveals both the devotional aims of the book and its patron’s desire for an intimate connection with the Passion narrative."

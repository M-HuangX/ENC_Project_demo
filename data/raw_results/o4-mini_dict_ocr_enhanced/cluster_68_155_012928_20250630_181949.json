In the upper register, Christ stands within an almond-shaped mandorla, his feet poised as if rising, holding a closed book in his left hand and a staff topped with a cross in his right. His halo is ringed by a dark blue nimbus. Two angels kneel on either side of the mandorla, their garments in alternating red and green, hands raised to support the frame. A painted band beneath bears the Latin inscription “SICVT VENIET QUOMODO VIDISTIS EUM,” quoting Acts 1:11. In the lower register, the Virgin Mary occupies the center, dressed in red cloak over blue tunic, hands raised in orans posture. She is flanked by six apostles on each side, dressed in varied tunics of blue, green, and red, some holding books, others gesturing upward toward Christ. All figures are barefoot, set against a burnished gold background. The composition is deeply frontal and hierarchically scaled, with Christ and Mary larger than the apostles. The border of interlaced foliage and quatrefoil medallions frames the scene, directing focus inward. The symmetry and color rhythm reinforce the solemn theological message of Christ’s promise to return."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This full-page Ascension illumination likely originates from a high-status devotional book of hours produced in a northern French workshop c. 1220–1240. The use of burnished gold leaf and ultramarine pigments indicates a significant patronage, while the sharp modelling of drapery and precise interlace border suggest the hand of a master illuminator influenced by the Anglo-Norman style. The two-register composition—with Christ in majesty above and the Virgin and apostles below—reflects standard iconography for the Ascension yet is enlivened by the rhythmic alternation of red and green garments among the figures. The inscription band quoting Acts 1:11 integrates text and image, emphasizing the theological promise of Christ’s return and reinforcing the book’s function as a visual aide-mémoire for personal devotion. Technical features such as raised gesso decoration and underdrawing visible in UV point to advanced workshop practices and close collaboration between scribe and illuminator. Compared to contemporaneous manuscripts like the Belles Heures of the Duke of Berry, this folio demonstrates an earlier, more hieratic aesthetic, yet its precision in line work and vibrant palette anticipate the later Gothic court style. Overall, the illumination balances traditional iconographic program with a rigorous formal clarity suited to private meditative use."

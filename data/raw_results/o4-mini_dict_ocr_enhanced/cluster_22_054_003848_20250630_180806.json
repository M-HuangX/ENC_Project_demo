      "scene_description": "This single allegorical scene depicts three figures on a continuous ground line: a grey-blue lion centered, biting a white sheep immediately to its left, and a solitary male figure in an orange-brown hooded tunic standing behind the lion. The man’s right hand is raised in alarm, the left placed on his chest. A stylized tree with a trefoil head rises at the far left margin. The background is a flat vermillion field punctuated by regular white gouache dots. The frame is composed of a double-lined border in azurite blue edged in black, with burnished gold leaf squares at the corners. Figures are outlined with bold black ink, without modeling shadows; depth is suggested by overlap only. The lion’s mane is rendered in sinuous black lines; the sheep’s fleece is indicated by closely spaced curved strokes. The male figure’s tunic shows simple folds. Secondary elements include the decorative white stippling and gold corner pieces. Symbolic components: lion as emblem of strength or Christus rex, sheep as innocence; the man’s gesture alludes to moral warning. Compositional focus rests on the predator–prey interaction at center. The image directly echoes the line of text beneath, “Le lion au rugissement,” integrating word and image to reinforce moral instruction."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This miniature likely originates from a early fourteenth-century bestiary produced in a northern French workshop, as suggested by the use of azurite blue, verdigris green, and burnished gold leaf characteristic of the period’s luxury manuscripts. The strong red background with white stippling and the double-lined frame recall London, BL Royal MS Bedford Bestiary (c. 1330). The simplified, decorative tree and the schematic ground line indicate a transitional phase between the naturalism of thirteenth-century illuminators and the stylized conventions of later Gothic workshop production. The bold black outlines and absence of spatial recession show reliance on traditional hierarchical scaling rather than perspective, underscoring the scene’s didactic function. Iconographically, the image serves as a moral allegory: the lion devouring the lamb evokes both the dangers of sin and Christ’s victory over Satan, a dual meaning reinforced by the accompanying Old French rubric. The solitary human figure behind the lion may represent the reader or moral agent warned against complacency. Comparatively, this scene shares compositional economy with the Bestiary of Phillips of Oxford (c. 1220), yet its color palette and stippling technique are more refined, reflecting advances in pigment layering and white highlighting. Overall, the miniature embodies the pedagogical aims of bestiaries while demonstrating innovations in decorative patterning and material execution during the early Gothic period."

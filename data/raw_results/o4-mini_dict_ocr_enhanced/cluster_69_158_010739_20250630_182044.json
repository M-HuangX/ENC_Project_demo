He wears a gold crown and holds a sceptre in his right hand and a globus cruciger in his left. His torso is clad in a red surcoat over chainmail, with a short gold skirt of mail below. A sword hangs at his left hip. He stands on a green ground line against a flat ultramarine field. The gold frame of the initial forms a circular border. Costume details include mail chausses visible on his legs and pointed azure shoes. His expression is solemn, with finely rendered facial features. Secondary decorative elements include white tracery on the blue ground and a curling vine-scroll in the left margin. Symbolic components are the sceptre (justice) and orb (worldly rule). Compositionally, the figure is centered to emphasize his status, with balanced negative space around him. Visual weight is concentrated on the crowned head and regalia objects. The historiated initial integrates with the text by marking the opening of a significant section, guiding the reader’s eye from image to inscription."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This historiated initial dates to the mid-13th century and likely originated in a northern French court workshop, reflecting the high value placed on regal imagery in illuminated manuscripts. The use of costly ultramarine and burnished gold leaf indicates a commission by or for a member of the aristocracy, situating the volume within the milieu of princely education or courtly display. Stylistically, the rigid frontal posture and symmetrical composition exhibit continuity with earlier Romanesque traditions, while the nuanced facial modeling and delicate penwork tracery point to emerging Gothic innovations. The collaborative nature of the workshop is evident in the consistent quality of the text’s Gothic textura and the figure’s refined execution, suggesting specialized scribes and illuminators. Iconographically, the sceptre and globus cruciger clearly communicate sovereign authority and the divine sanction of kingship, aligning secular power with sacral overtones. The initial’s role at the opening of a textual section underscores the interplay between word and image as mnemonic and didactic tools. Comparatively, this illumination bears resemblance to the Psalter of Blanche of Castile in its color palette and ornamental motifs, yet it introduces more naturalistic facial types and heightened gold relief work. Thus, the page embodies a transitional moment in manuscript art, marrying traditional hierarchical iconography with the burgeoning naturalism and technical prowess of the Gothic era."

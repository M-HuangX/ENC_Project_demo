      "scene_description": "In the left half, a recumbent figure lies upon a curtained bier draped in sumptuous folds, the head propped on a cushion. A bishop in a mitred cope stands at the foot holding a crozier and intently reading from an open pontifical, while a kneeling cleric presents the sacrament. Two attendants flank the bier, holding lit candles. Above them angels hover in the sky, their wings outspread. To the right, within an almond-shaped mandorla of burnished gold, Christ sits enthroned on a cushioned bench, robes cascading to the ground. A crowned, veiled figure—the soul—kneels with uplifted hands; Christ extends his right hand in blessing and his left holds a fillet or small crown. Spatially, the bier occupies the left foreground, its attendants arranged in a shallow arc, while the mandorla scene is set slightly behind, overlapping the bed frame. The bishop appears slightly larger in scale than the attendants, but Christ is the largest, emphasizing divine preeminence. Costumes include the bishop’s richly patterned cope with gold edging, the cleric’s white alb trimmed with red, the dying figure’s simple shroud, and the soul’s flowing gown of pale hue. The interplay of gestures—the bishop’s bent posture, the soul’s reverent approach—unifies the two episodes."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This double‐scene miniature likely dates to a mid‐14th-century Parisian workshop, reflecting the period’s sophisticated integration of text and image for personal devotion. The juxtaposition of the saint’s last rites with the soul’s reception by Christ exemplifies a theological program emphasizing the efficacy of liturgical prayer at death and the immediate heavenly reward. The use of burnished gold and ultramarine situates the manuscript within the luxury market for private patrons, while the fine Gothic textura script and underdrawing evidence suggest collaboration between a master illuminator and professional scribe. Iconographically, the mandorla recall Carolingian antecedents yet is treated with Gothic naturalism in the voluminous drapery and expressive gestures. Thematically, the composition aligns with the growing emphasis on affective devotion characteristic of the mid-14th century, inviting the viewer’s empathetic participation in the dying saint’s passage. Comparisons with the Hours of Jeanne d’Evreux reveal similar punchwork halos and hierarchical scaling, suggesting participation in a common Parisian illuminators’ network. Technically, the layered pigment application and careful gesso modeling demonstrate advanced material knowledge and a high level of workshop specialization. This image thus occupies a pivotal moment between traditional hagiographic illustration and the emerging personal prayer book culture of late medieval France."

The figure on the right (William) wears a knee-length mail hauberk with coif and conical helmet, holding a spear upright; his left hand rests on the recipient’s shoulder. The figure on the left (Harold) also in full mail and round-topped helmet, extends both hands to receive the spear. To the left of them, two mounted knights in mail ride rightward, their horses caparisoned in alternating red and dark brown; one knight carries a round shield with simple boss, the other carries a lance. On the far right edge, another caparisoned horse advances. All figures stand on a single embroidered ground line of pebble motifs. Secondary decorative borders above and below feature stylized birds, lions, and small crosses, forming continuous registers. The embroidered caption above—“HIC WILLEM DEDIT HAROLDO ARMA”—directly labels the event. There is no architectural setting; emphasis is on figures and gesture. The spatial arrangement is shallow, with little overlap, and a clear horizontal procession directs the viewer’s eye from left-mounted entourage toward the central act of investiture."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "The investiture scene “HIC WILLEM DEDIT HAROLDO ARMA” epitomizes the Bayeux Tapestry’s role as both historical record and Norman propaganda. Produced in an Anglo-Saxon embroidery workshop circa 1070, its halftone palette and crisp outlines align with Romanesque embroidered revivals in liturgical textiles yet serve a secular narrative. The absence of architectural framing and reliance on border registers echo continental manuscript illumination conventions transposed into textile form. The central act—William handing a spear to Harold—reinforces feudal bonds and legitimizes Norman claims to England through visual captions in embroidered majuscule Latin. The professional quality of the wool yarns and linen, the stability of natural dyes, and the precise couching demonstrate technical mastery. Iconographically, the scene conveys sovereign authority: the spear functions not only as weapon but as symbol of investiture. Comparatively, while Parisian illuminators of the mid-12th century would later elaborate narrative framing, this earlier work’s directness and economy of means testify to a collaborative Norman-Anglo-Saxon atelier under high patronage. The tapestry thus bridges textile and manuscript traditions, innovating a monumental narrative form that influenced subsequent monumental embroidery and historiated manuscript cycles. It remains a unique testament to the visual politics of the Norman Conquest."

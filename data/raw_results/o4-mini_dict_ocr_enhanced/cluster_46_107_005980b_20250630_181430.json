A bishop in ultramarine robe and white mitre stands centrally, gesturing toward a prostrate man in red tunic, arms flung back. A grey-robed attendant steps upon the condemned, while two elders—one in green holding a closed book, one in red—observe. A scribe at left writes at a desk under sculpted reliefs. Figures overlap to indicate depth; the bishop and attendant occupy the foreground.\nRight panel: Set against a rocky exterior, three men in red, blue and brown robes stand behind a kneeling female saint in a deep blue mantle and white veil, hands clasped. One executioner grasps her arm, another in brown raises a club. A distant hilltop town is visible. The saint’s golden halo contrasts with the violent act. Both scenes share a common gold border and compositional balance."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This page, likely from a 15th-century French hagiographic compilation, reflects the monastic workshop tradition of illuminated saint’s lives. The careful use of ultramarine and burnished gold indicates a high-status commission, perhaps for a noble patron’s private devotion, while the Gothic textura rotunda script and red rubrication demonstrate professional execution. The sequential two-panel miniature narrates a miracle and subsequent martyrdom, framed by micro-architectural elements that echo contemporary church interiors. Underdrawing visible under UV and raised gesso attest to sophisticated material techniques. Iconographically, the bishop’s intervention prefigures divine justice, while the female martyr exemplifies steadfast faith under persecution, reinforcing moral exemplarity. Stylistically, the work balances hierarchical figure sizing with early attempts at depth through overlapping and floor patterning, characteristic of late Gothic spatial experimentation. Comparatively, its palette and architectural framing relate closely to other manuscripts from the Parisian school, though the rotunda script suggests a provincial scriptorium influenced by courtly models. As a didactic and devotional object, the page bridges theological instruction and aesthetic display, embodying the era’s intertwining of religious pedagogy and visual splendor."

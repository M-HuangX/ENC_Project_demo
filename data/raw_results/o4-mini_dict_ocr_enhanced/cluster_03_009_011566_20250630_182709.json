The left margin shows a crenellated tower from which a banner flies. Knights on the right charge forward with lances couched, while those on the left receive the blow with raised shields. The horses are shown in mid-stride, hooves overlapping to suggest forward momentum. Each rider wears a short surcoat over mail; shields bear varied emblems (chevrons, crosses, geometric devices) in red, blue and gold. Behind the foremost combatants, secondary cavalry close ranks. The composition fills a square frame, with no open sky, emphasizing the intensity of close quarters conflict. Below the miniature, a red rubric introduces the next section. Marginal vignettes at the foot depict three knights advancing on horseback and, to their right, six men unloading siege equipment—a continuation of the martial theme."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This illuminated page, likely produced in a Parisian workshop in the mid-14th century, reflects the elite taste for vernacular epic and historiographical narrative. The quality of materials—ultramarine, burnished gold, and fine calf vellum—along with the professional textura quadrata script, suggest a commission by or for high nobility. Artistically, the battle scene demonstrates a transitional approach to spatial representation: while true linear perspective remains absent, overlapping figures and a low horizon convey a sense of depth and movement. The dense gold-patterned background and punchwork align with contemporaneous Parisian illumination styles, notably the so-called “Court School.” Border decoration with vine scrolls, grotesques, and alternating red-blue inhabited initials further connect this folio to luxury Books of Hours and secular compilations of the period. Iconographically, the page emphasizes chivalric valor and feudal hierarchy, with knights in individualized heraldry charging across a uniform field. The marginal vignettes extend the martial theme, creating a visual commentary on siegecraft and logistics, thus enriching the text’s depiction of warfare. Compared to other illuminated chronicles, this manuscript blends traditional gothic ornamentation with an emerging narrative dynamism, illustrating the interplay between innovation and established workshop conventions in 14th-century France."

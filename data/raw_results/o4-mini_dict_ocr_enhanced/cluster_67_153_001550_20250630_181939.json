He raises his right hand in blessing and holds a small vessel. On the right, a youth kneels with head thrown back, mouth open, as a small horned, winged demon is expelled upward. Two male attendants stand behind: one grips the youth’s shoulders, the other supports his arm. All figures stand upon a simple horizontal ground line. The saint and group face each other across the center, forming a tight triangular composition capped by the demon. The saint’s drapery shows fluid wash shading; the attendants wear knee-length tunics and plain hose. The youth’s tunic is gathered at the waist. The demon’s contorted body, bat-like wings, and forked tail are rendered in fine pen lines and minimal wash. The blank background focuses attention on the exorcism act."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This miniature, executed in grisaille with polychrome accents, likely originates from a late 13th- or early 14th-century French workshop, reflecting the period’s experimentation with monochrome painting to evoke sculptural relief. The use of brown and gray washes for the exorcism scene contrasts with the vibrant initial and purple lamb medallion, underscoring a transitional aesthetic that balances austerity and ornament. The finely executed Gothic textura quadrata script and rubrication indicate a professional scriptorium, possibly attached to an urban cathedral. Iconographically, the scene dramatizes a saint’s miraculous expulsion of a demon, emphasizing the triumph of sanctity over evil; the vessel held by the saint may reference relic translation or the application of a blessed substance. The lamb medallion functionally aligns with Agnus Dei symbolism, reinforcing themes of redemption. Technically, the presence of underdrawing and raised gesso reveals sophisticated material practices. Comparatively, the miniature shares affinities with contemporaneous Parisian books of hours employing grisaille (e.g., the Psalter of Robert de Lisle), yet its subject—a specialized exorcism—suggests inclusion in a hagiographical codex for clerical instruction. Overall, the page exemplifies a convergence of liturgical purpose, refined workshop technique, and evolving aesthetic trends within high medieval illumination."

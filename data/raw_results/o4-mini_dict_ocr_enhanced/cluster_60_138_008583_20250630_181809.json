      "scene_description": "This full-page miniature depicts the coronation Mass of a French king. At center, the newly anointed monarch kneels before a bishop wearing a richly decorated mitre and holding both a gilded chalice and a host wafer. The king wears a blue robe strewn with gold fleur-de-lis, his hands raised in reverence. To the left, six attendants in fleur-de-lis patterned garments stand behind a youth presenting a gold crown on a velvet cushion; another holds a ceremonial sword with gilt hilt. The tiled floor beneath them is laid in red and white lozenges, creating a shallow stage. At right, a small altar draped in red cloth with a carved reredos depicting saints anchors the composition. All figures are rendered against a dense ultramarine background punched with gold dots. The arrangement emphasizes the central sacramental moment: the convergence of secular regalia and ecclesiastical authority. Attendants’ postures and glances guide the viewer’s eye from the crown-bearers through the kneeling figure to the bishop, reinforcing the ritual’s solemn progression. No marginal scenes or text intrude on the frame, marking this as a standalone depiction of royal investiture."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This illumination appears to originate from a mid-14th-century French court workshop, likely commissioned to commemorate the coronation of a Capetian monarch. The lavish ultramarine and gold palette, together with the fleur-de-lis motif, underscores the political alliance between the crown and the Church. The image’s separation from text suggests its inclusion in a ceremonial manual or secular chronicle rather than a devotional codex. Stylistically, the miniaturist employs a hierarchical composition and delicate quill outlining typical of Parisian ateliers. The use of punched gold in the background and raised gesso underlayer reflects advanced technical practices aimed at creating a jewel-like effect, paralleling works such as the Grandes Chroniques de France. Iconographically, the juxtaposition of regalia bearers and the Eucharistic action signals an ideological message: royal authority is both divinely sanctioned and sacramentally validated. This reinforces the medieval notion of the king as God’s anointed instrument on earth. Comparatively, the image shares formal affinities with the Coronation scenes in the Psalter of Saint Louis, yet innovates by integrating the Mass into the visual program, thus blending liturgical and political narratives in a single frame. The result is a sophisticated fusion of tradition and innovation, marking a high point of French Gothic illumination."

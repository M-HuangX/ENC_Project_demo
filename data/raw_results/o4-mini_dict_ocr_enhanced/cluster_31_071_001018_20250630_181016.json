In the foreground, a kneeling attendant lays a cloak before the animal. Behind Christ stand two haloed figures—one possibly an apostle—ready to assist. Above, two figures lean over a crenellated parapet, lowering a red garment. The circular frame encloses a burnished gold ground. Christ wears a red tunic with a blue mantle highlighted in white; the donkey is rendered in white lead with grey shading. Figures overlap to create spatial depth; Christ is slightly larger, indicating his import. The balcony is depicted in blue and red bands with white decorative motifs. No natural landscape appears, focusing attention on the sacred event."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "Produced in a high medieval workshop, likely mid-thirteenth century in northern France, this historiated initial illustrating the Entry into Jerusalem inaugurates Psalm 64 in a Psalter designed for liturgical use. The lavish application of burnished gold and ultramarine points to high-quality materials, suggesting a monastic or cathedral commission funded by an affluent patron. The illumination reflects the stylistic conventions of the Parisian school, with its crisp line work, rich diapered backgrounds, and fluid pen-flourished initials. The collaboration of at least two hands is evident in the distinct approaches to figure drapery and decorative scrollwork. Iconographically, the motif of Christ on the donkey loaded with palms underscores the humble kingship of Christ and fulfills Zecharian prophecy, resonating with monastic meditative traditions. Such an image would serve both as a focal point for communal devotion and as a mnemonic device linking text and visual exegesis. Technically, the use of raised gesso beneath gold and subtle hatching for volume demonstrates sophisticated material mastery, while the uniform script of Gothic textura quadrata indicates professional scribal production. Compared with contemporaneous manuscripts like the Psalter of Blanche of Castile, this example shares the interplay of red and blue in initials but innovates through the dynamic balcony scene of garment-laying. Overall, the folio combines traditional iconography with compositional vitality, situating it within the evolving demands of thirteenth-century liturgical art."

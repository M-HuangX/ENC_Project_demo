On the left, a standing figure in a long red cloak and coif holds a sprig of roquette at chest height. On the right, a slightly bent figure in a pink tunic and red hose reaches toward a rosette of leaves at the base of a plant, plucking its flowering raceme. Beneath their feet stretches a row of roquette plants with characteristic pinnate leaves and yellow inflorescences. A tall, slender-trunked tree with dark green foliage and red fruit occupies the center background. Behind the right figure a dense cresson bush is visible. All elements rest on an ochre-colored ground line without architectural framing or deep recession."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This leaf appears to be from a late medieval herbal or pharmacological compendium produced in a professional workshop, perhaps in northern Italy or southern France during the early fifteenth century. The careful delineation of roquette and cresson reflects the period’s growing interest in materia medica and the empirical study of plant morphology. The use of a central tree as a compositional axis and the placement of two figures in balanced symmetry demonstrate an exchange between scientific illustration and courtly book illumination conventions. The narrow red frame and rubricated title echo contemporary Books of Hours, suggesting that herbal treatises appropriated devotional layout strategies to lend authority and visual cohesion. Pigment selection—vibrant greens and warm reds—parallels the palette of high-end devotional manuscripts, indicating that this work was intended for an educated elite, possibly a physician-scholar or noble patron. Iconographically, the figure in red cloak may symbolize the learned status of the herbalist, while the undifferentiated background and flat spatial treatment emphasize the morphological features of the plants rather than narrative context. Comparisons with the Tacuinum Sanitatis highlight the era’s interdisciplinary fusion of botanical, culinary, and medicinal knowledge. The absence of gold leaf and the emphasis on naturalistic color suggest a utilitarian function, whereas the precise execution and framed layout reflect a workshop versed in luxury illumination techniques."

He wears a long azurite-blue cloak over a golden tunic, with a small gold crown atop his head and a neatly trimmed brown beard. His left hand supports the book, while his right is raised as if poised to write or read aloud. The figure sits on a simple ledge indicated by a thin horizontal stroke. The gold-leaf background is set within the letterform, itself outlined in brown ink and infilled with red penwork along the interior curve. The ascender stroke of the initial extends diagonally down the left margin, transforming into a vine scroll of red and blue foliage and culminating in a secondary ornamental roundel. To the right, six lines of Gothic textura quadrata separate the image from the main text. The composition centers on David’s reflective pose and integrates text and image to emphasize the psalm’s opening invocation, balancing the visual weight between figure and script."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This historiated initial of King David writing the Psalms exemplifies mid-14th-century French illumination practices, likely produced in a courtly Parisian workshop. The use of burnished gold leaf for the background and the precise Gothic textura quadrata script reflect a commission intended for private devotion by a wealthy patron. The integration of red and blue pen flourishes, combined with a raised gesso ground, demonstrates technical mastery in layering pigments and decorative techniques. Iconographically, David’s portrayal as both monarch and scribe underscores the dual authority of divine inspiration and royal power, linking Old Testament precedent to contemporary assertions of political legitimacy. The marginal vine scroll, rendered in stylized foliage, aligns with the vegetal ornamentation common in Books of Hours and Psalters of this period, providing a visual frame that guides the reader’s eye and reinforces the sacred content. Comparative analysis with manuscripts such as the Psalter of Blanche of Castile reveals shared features—centralized historiation, polychrome penwork, and trimmed margins—while this example’s confident underdrawing and punch-dotted gold ground suggest a distinct atelier influence, perhaps that of the Master of the Brussels Initials. Overall, the folio balances traditional iconographic program with refined technical execution, reflecting the transition toward more personal devotional objects in the later medieval period."

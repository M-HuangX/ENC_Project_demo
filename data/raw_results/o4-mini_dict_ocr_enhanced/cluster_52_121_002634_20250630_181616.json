To the left stands a winged angel (symbol of St. Matthew) raising the scroll’s end, and to the right a seated ox (symbol of St. Luke) grasps the other end. All three rest on a deep ultramarine semicircular field framed by a gilded archivolt. Below this major arch are four smaller arches supported on slender columns patterned in vermillion interlace, their capitals and bases highlighted in gold and green. Beneath each arch runs a narrow red capital band marking the header for each gospel concordance column. The lists of chapter numerals are arranged in four neat vertical registers, the script in dark brown ink with red ruling lines. The outer border is filled with scrolling acanthus leaves in green and red, edged in gold, with two peacocks at the archivolt springers. Spatially, the composition is flat and hierarchical: divine symbols occupy the upper register, architecture frames the middle, and text dominates the lower part. Decorative features—raised gesso under gold, punchwork in arches, and the rhythmic interlace—underscore the prestige of this liturgical apparatus."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "Produced in a high‐end scriptorium, this canon table headpiece dates to the late 11th or early 12th century and reflects the refinement of Ottonian and early Romanesque book illumination. Its architectural framing — a large gilded archivolt and smaller interlaced columns — echoes contemporary church facades, creating a visual metaphor that the gospels themselves are the true edifice of the Church. The dominant ultramarine and gold palette underscores the divine authority of the evangelists, while the precise Carolingian minuscule and careful rubrication reveal a professional hand likely associated with a cathedral workshop. Technically, the use of raised gesso beneath leaf gold and intricate punchwork attests to advanced material competence. Iconographically, the placement of the lion, angel, and ox on a unified semicircular ground abstracts the evangelist typology into a cohesive theological program: the four figures form a celestial chorus heralding the scriptural text below. Comparatively, it shares affinities with the Gospel Book of Otto III in straddling earlier Carolingian traditions and emerging Romanesque sensibilities. The elaborate border of acanthus and peacocks further situates it within a classical revival trend seen in contemporaneous manuscripts from Reichenau and Metz. Overall, this canon table exemplifies the transition from Ottonian monumentalism to the more decorative and symbolic Romanesque style, balancing medieval architectural illusionism with precise book‐art conventions."

At center, a seated monarch clothed in flowing gray-white robes holds his right hand to his breast while a pope in triple-tiara and pallium places a golden crown upon his head. The pope is accompanied by two bishops in mitres and cope, their hands raised in benediction. To the right of the throne, two nobles wearing long tunics and mantles stand in supplication, one with hand on chest, the other gesturing toward the king. The golden throne has zoomorphic armrests terminating in stylized lion or griffin heads set against a deep ultramarine field decorated with a regular pattern of red and white dots. The quatrefoil frame rests on a narrow gold fillet. Spatially, the central axis unifies the composition; figures overlap to suggest depth. The monarch’s submissive posture and the pope’s authoritative gesture underscore the transfer of secular investiture. The border’s vine scroll extends into the text area, visually linking narrative and script."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This miniature, set within a mid-14th-century chronicle of southwestern France, captures the symbolic nexus of secular and ecclesiastical power through the papal coronation of a regional lord. Produced in a court-affiliated workshop, the crisp Gothic textura script and the lavish use of ultramarine and burnished gold reflect a high level of patronage and technical sophistication. The absence of architectural setting focuses attention on the figures’ gestures and hierarchical scale: the triple-tiered tiara visually contrasts with the simpler royal crown, underscoring the pope’s superiority. The extended vine-scroll border, characteristic of Rayonnant illumination, frames the narrative both physically and symbolically, drawing the viewer’s eye from text to image. Iconographically, the scene alludes to contemporary investiture disputes and serves as a visual assertion of papal endorsement for the patron’s rule. Comparisons with Parisian chronicles of the same period reveal similar quatrefoil frames and dot-patterned backgrounds, suggesting shared stylistic currents across Gascon and Île-de-France workshops. Yet the emphasis on plain gray-white robes for the king—rather than richly colored garments—suggests local aesthetic preferences or a deliberate self-image of pious humility. Overall, the miniature combines established Gothic conventions with subtle regional innovations to communicate both political legitimacy and devotional piety."

In the left compartment, eight figures of Jewish priests in long tunics and cloaks, some bearded, cluster in front of a draped white curtain with green vine scrolls. Their animated gestures—pointing fingers, furrowed brows—convey deliberation. Robes alternate blue and red, with trimmed hems in gold. In the right compartment, Christ, distinguished by a cruciform halo and seated on a wooden bench with a patterned cushion, is flanked by three figures: to his left the bearded high priest in white robes, holding a scroll; a young attendant stands behind; and at the far right a figure raises a cloth or vessel. The bench rests on a tiled platform. Christ’s posture is frontal, hand raised in blessing. Both compartments share an overarching red frame and are separated by a central column supporting twin round arches."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This diptych miniature, likely executed in a high-status monastic or cathedral workshop in the late twelfth or early thirteenth century, exemplifies the transitional proto-Gothic style, fusing Romanesque architectural framing with emerging Gothic figure treatment. The crisp, angular script and the refined execution of underdrawing and gesso-raised gold indicate a professional scriptorium, perhaps associated with a cathedral school in northern France. The two-compartment composition underscores the didactic function of the image: first conveying the priests’ conspiracy, then Christ’s appearance before the high priest, in strict sequential order. The use of burnished gold leaf for the divine milieu and the careful alternation of ultramarine and vermilion robes reveal both iconographic hierarchy and technical innovation in pigment layering. Iconographically, the cruciform halo and gestural echoes between scenes reinforce Christ’s divine authority juxtaposed against human betrayal. The panel’s formal qualities—overlapping figures, rhythmic color alternation, and disciplined architectural motifs—connect it to contemporaneous Gospel books and Passion cycles. Comparative analysis suggests affinity with the Parisian ‘Master of the Biblia de Saint-Paul’ workshop, yet the flat backgrounds and punchwork bear English Channel School influences. This miniature thus occupies a pivotal moment in manuscript illumination, blending tradition with nascent Gothic spatial logic to serve both liturgical ritual and the visual reinforcement of theological narrative."

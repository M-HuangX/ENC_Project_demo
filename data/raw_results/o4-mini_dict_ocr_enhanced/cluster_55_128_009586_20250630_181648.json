      "scene_description": "In the lower register Moses appears seated on a low bench at the left edge, clad in an ochre-yellow robe over an undergarment, his hair and beard rendered in brown ink strokes. He raises his right hand in an orator’s gesture, palm outward, while his left hand rests on his knee. To his right stands a youthful figure in a red-brown tunic (Joshua), hands at his sides. Further right is a compact group of approximately ten Israelite men, each distinguished by curly hair rendered in brown and robes alternating between deep blue and ochre, standing shoulder to shoulder in two staggered rows. Their hands are raised in attentive orative poses. All figures are outlined in black ink with minimal internal hatching to suggest drapery folds. The floor plane is unindicated, and no architectural or landscape elements intrude. The horizontal boundary line aligns with the frame, echoing the line of Moses’s bench. The spatial organization is compressed, with larger scale for Moses relative to the crowd, indicating his authority. Robe folds are indicated by simple curved lines and occasional cross-hatching, while faces are depicted with almond-shaped eyes, prominent noses, and small mouths. The group is framed by the border, focusing visual attention on the interaction between Moses and his listeners."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid–13th-century miniature, likely produced in a northern French workshop, exemplifies the didactic integration of image and text characteristic of biblical commentaries of the period. The linear two-register format underscores sequential typology: divine commissioning of Joshua followed by Moses’s authoritative instruction. The choice of azurite and vermilion—imported luxury pigments—alongside simple ochre earths points to a high-status commission, yet the restrained decorative program suggests a monastic rather than courtly audience. The work’s Gothic book hand and confident pen lines align with Parisian scriptoria practices, while the minimal architectural setting focuses attention on the narrative action. Iconographically, the striped cloud denotes God’s transcendent presence, reinforcing the divine sanction of Israelite leadership and the impending crossing of the Jordan. Scholarly use is further implied by the framing of the miniature between explanatory Latin texts, facilitating visual exegesis. Comparisons with the Biblia Historiale and Parisian glossed Psalters reveal similar compositional devices—horizontal registers, gestural continuity, and flat backgrounds—though this example is distinguished by its two-scene compression and plainly ruled borders. The manuscript thus bridges exegetical function and visual pedagogy, embodying the pedagogical innovations of 13th-century biblical illumination."

The lower scene repeats the judge on the left and executioner centrally, now placing the two green-robed bodies into a stone-arched niche composed of yellowish blocks outlined in brown; their heads remain severed with blood rendered by minium strokes. Both registers employ a planar composition on a single ground line, with figures of nearly equal height, minimal depth cues, and consistent color palette. Heads of the martyrs in both scenes are bearded, eyes closed, emphasizing death; the architectural arch in the second scene provides a framing device that echoes the outer frame. The repetition of principal figures and actions across registers underscores the narrative of martyrdom and judicial authority."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-register illumination, executed in a Gothic textualis quadrata script environment, likely originates from a 13th-century Western European workshop catering to monastic audiences. The clear narrative progression—decapitation of saints followed by deposition of their bodies in a tomb niche—reflects the growing emphasis on vivid martyrdom scenes in devotional manuscripts. The restrained palette of verdigris green, ochre brown, and minium red, applied flatly without shading, aligns with English and northern French illumination practices of the period, favoring graphic clarity over painterly depth. The repetition of the crowned judge and executioner underscores the judicial authority rejecting Christian witnesses, a visual assertion of ecclesiastical power over transgressors. Technically, the confident underdrawing and deliberate use of ruling lines indicate a professional scriptorium with strict layout conventions. Iconographically, the graphic depiction of blood serves both as a testament to sanctity and a cautionary emblem of divine suffering. Comparatively, this miniatures share compositional simplicity with manuscripts like the Morgan Beatus—where sequential narrative underlines typological continuity—but diverge in their austere decoration, suggesting a workshop balancing economy with doctrinal immediacy. Overall, the illumination marries traditional martyr iconography with a sequential, almost cinematic, presentation, advancing devotional engagement through clear, repetitive visual rhetoric."

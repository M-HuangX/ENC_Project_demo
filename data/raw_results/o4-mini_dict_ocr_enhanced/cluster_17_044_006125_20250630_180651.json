      "scene_description": "This full-page illumination depicts the moment at the empty tomb following Christ’s Resurrection. A winged angel, haloed and robed in white and pale yellow, sits upon a green rock slab within a recessed architectural niche. He holds a slender staff in the left hand and gestures with the right toward two Myrrh­bearers standing left of the tomb entrance. The women, traditionally Mary Magdalene and Mary of James, wear chapel veils and long mantles of ultramarine and russet, each holding small ointment jars. At right two Roman soldiers in knee-length mail shirts and conical helmets slump against the wall, their round shields and spears indicating their watch. The angel’s enlarged scale and central placement establish him as principal figure. The hollowed niche and rock form a compact spatial composition with overlapping figures suggesting limited depth. The Myrrh­bearers’ downward gazes and gestures emphasize their revelation, while the soldiers’ closed eyes and drooped posture convey astonished slumber. Secondary decorative features include the red-fillet outer frame and punched halo patterns. Symbolic elements: the empty burial shroud at angel’s feet, myrrh jars, and open tomb signify the Resurrection. Compositional focus rests on divine proclamation, with supporting figures arranged in balanced groups to left and right."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This illumination likely originates in a mid-13th-century Parisian workshop, reflecting the Gothic scholastic emphasis on personal devotion and visual meditation upon biblical events. The architectural framing and canopy, with its simplified classical motifs, reveal the early French Gothic synthesis of Romanesque solidity and emerging verticality, while the stylized drapery folds and punched halos demonstrate the influence of the ‘English Channel School’ circulation of styles. The scene’s centralized composition—an enlarged angel seated within the tomb’s niche—underscores the theological import of the Resurrection, directing the viewer’s gaze to the divine announcement delivered to the myrrh-bearers. Technically, the use of layered lead white highlights, fine quill outlines, and burnished gesso-backed gold leaf exhibits a high level of workshop expertise, suggesting a well-funded commission for a noble patron’s book of hours. Iconographically, the absent figure of Christ, implied by the empty shroud and tomb, creates a powerful absence-presence effect, in keeping with contemporary devotional practices that encouraged empathetic identification with scriptural drama. Comparisons with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile highlight shared pigment palettes and framing devices, while the distinctive green rock under the angel’s feet suggests local innovations in color symbolism, perhaps echoing the verdant landscapes of northern France. Overall, this miniature balances traditional typology with subtle compositional and technical novelties characteristic of 1250–1270 Parisian illumination."

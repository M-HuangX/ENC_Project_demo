      "scene_description": "A single full-page scene depicting two standing bishop saints beneath a triple Gothic arch. Each figure is haloed with burnished gold and wears a mitre: the left saint holds a gilded book or reliquary at chest height, his right hand poised in blessing or inscription gesture; the right saint grips a long crozier in his left hand while his right hand is raised in benediction. Both figures wear albs beneath voluminous chasubles—left in deep red lined in green, right in red with a grey-violet cloak. Robes display finely incised folds with subtle white highlighting. Beneath their feet lies a patterned tile or carpet, rendered in contrasting blue and white geometric designs. The saints stand on a flat ground line with no illusionistic space beyond the arches. Their expressions are solemn, eyes cast slightly downward. Secondary decorative elements include a field of white fleurons on ultramarine, red spandrels punched with white dots, and a thin gold border framing the composition. Symbolic components: gold halos denote sanctity; mitres and crozier signify episcopal office; the book suggests teaching or gospel authority. The composition centers both figures equally, distributing visual weight symmetrically and emphasizing their joint liturgical and spiritual role."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This full-page miniature of two bishop saints exemplifies mid-14th-century Gothic illumination, likely produced in a northern French workshop. The use of deep ultramarine and burnished gold, together with punched patterns in red spandrels, reflects Parisian luxury manuscript trends under royal patronage. The dual saints, presented symmetrically beneath architectural canopies, underline the cultic importance of episcopal intercession in private devotion. Technical features—such as raised gesso for gilding and precise quill underdrawing—demonstrate a collaborative atelier practice with specialized gilders and painters. The balanced composition departs from earlier, more hierarchical arrangements by granting equal visual weight to both figures, suggesting an innovative approach within a traditional iconographic program. Iconographically, the mitre, crozier, and gospel book underscore teaching authority and sacramental function, linking the manuscript’s imagery to the liturgical cycle of a Book of Hours. Comparatively, the refined color palette and punchwork echo the Psalter of Blanche of Castile (BnF Latin 115). This illuminator’s workshop may have been influenced by the evolving aesthetic of the English Channel School, merging English linear elegance with French chromatic richness. The result is a work that harmonizes established saintly iconography with subtle compositional innovation, aligning devotional intimacy with the display of manuscript opulence."

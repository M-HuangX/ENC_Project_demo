The use of trees and text within the scene suggests a connection between places."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This manuscript likely served as a political or diplomatic document, perhaps detailing territorial planning or travel routes. The combination of text and simple map-like illustrations suggests it was intended for individuals of authority, such as nobles or military leaders. The limited palette and straightforward composition indicate a practical and functional approach, rather than purely decorative. The style reflects the 14th-century emphasis on realistic and useful representations, coinciding with growing interest in geographic depiction. This fits within the broader context of medieval cartography and the use of manuscripts in administrative and governmental contexts."

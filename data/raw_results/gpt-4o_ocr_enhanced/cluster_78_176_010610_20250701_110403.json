    "scholarly_interpretation": "This manuscript illumination, originating from a late medieval courtly workshop, exemplifies the confluence of religious devotion and artistic opulence typical of the 14th century. The image of the Last Supper, a central theme in Christian iconography, is powerfully expressed through hierarchical composition, where Christ’s central placement and the use of gold highlights underscore his divine prominence. The Gothic architectural detailing frames the scene, enhancing its sacred ambience. Likely crafted for a wealthy patron, the manuscript served both as an object of private devotion and as a testament to the patron’s status and piety. Stylistically, it reflects the influence of the International Gothic style with its emphasis on graceful lines and elaborate decoration. The meticulous use of gold leaf and deep ultramarine pigment, achieved through lapis lazuli, indicates high-quality materials associated with luxury manuscripts. The scene's iconography adheres closely to traditional interpretations, reinforcing communal recognition of the biblical narrative. The preservation of this artifact allows for the continued study of medieval religious practices and artistic techniques, offering insight into the spiritual and social contexts from which it emerged. Overall, this manuscript represents a harmonious blend of doctrinal affirmation and artistic sophistication, characteristic of its time and milieu."

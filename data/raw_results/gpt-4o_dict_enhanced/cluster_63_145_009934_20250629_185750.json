    "scholarly_interpretation": "This manuscript page illustrates the martyrdom of St. Stephen, emphasizing themes of faith and sacrifice prevalent in martyrological texts. Dating from a monastic context, likely created between the 12th and 13th centuries, such images were educational tools, aiding monks in internalizing and reflecting on the virtues and trials of saints. The hierarchical composition—marked by the prominent seated king overseeing the action—underscores themes of divine authority and judgment. With minimal shading, the depiction relies on bold lines and flat colors to convey its message succinctly, typical of other contemporaneous works. The presence of a king ties the narrative to notions of earthly authority, reflecting theological and political dimensions important in medieval thought. This artwork shares stylistic elements with other English and French manuscripts of the period, blending simple compositions with robust outlines to present dramatic, didactic tales. The choice of hagiographic narrative aligns with monastic values of endurance and piety, serving both an instructional and devotional function."

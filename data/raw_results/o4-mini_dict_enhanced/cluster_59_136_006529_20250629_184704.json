He wears a long tunic with voluminous drapery folds indicated by fine white highlights and holds an inscribed scroll bearing the incipit of Psalm 10. The letter interior is divided into three compartments: the upper half-round containing the standing figure, the long narrow shaft filled with intricate interlace vine scrolls alternating ultramarine and vermilion with leaf green details, and the lower half-round depicting a small seated animal motif echoing the vine pattern. The figure’s hand is raised in a gesture of blessing or proclamation, suggesting the psalmist King David. The background of the initial is burnished gold, punched with bezant patterns, against which the figure and ornament stand in high contrast. Text is written to the right in a single column of Gothic textura quadrata. Secondary decorative features include foliate terminals and acanthus leaf scrolls framing the compartments, reinforcing the central focus on the psalmist’s authority as author of the biblical text."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This historiated initial N, opening Psalm 10, likely originates from a high-end liturgical Psalter produced in a major European urban workshop circa 1250–1275. The use of burnished gold leaf and ultramarine signals access to costly materials, suggesting a wealthy patron or ecclesiastical institution. The figure, interpreted as King David, embodies the scriptural authority of the Psalter and reflects the period’s emphasis on personalized devotional imagery. Stylistically, the sharp angularity of the Gothic textualis script and the rhythmic interlace panels indicate familiarity with English Channel School conventions, while the vertical compartmentalization of the letter reveals a French influence in layout design. Technical execution—visible underdrawing, layered pigment building, and gesso relief—demonstrates a collaborative atelier workflow where specialist illuminators, painters, and rubricators contributed. Iconographically, the scroll functions as both a textual attribute and a visual echo of the adjacent script, reinforcing the unity of word and image in medieval exegesis. Comparatively, this page aligns with contemporaneous Psalters such as the Blanche of Castile Psalter in its integration of zoomorphic lower panels but innovates through the pronounced centrality of the psalmist figure. The manuscript thus occupies a transitional moment, integrating traditional iconography with emerging Gothic spatial sensibilities to serve both liturgical and private devotional functions."

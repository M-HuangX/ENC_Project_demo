In the upper register, Naboth stands at left on a single flat ground line, clad in a loose umber-brown tunic and holding a tall wooden staff, his right hand raised in supplication. Opposite him, King Ahab sits facing left, wearing a shell-gold and vermillion crown and a flowing ochre robe rendered in flat wash; his right hand is extended in reception, left resting on his knee. No architectural frame confines them; background remains plain parchment. A thin ruled line separates the registers. In the lower register, Ahab kneels on the same ground line at left, his crown and robe identical to the upper scene, right hand raised in prayer, left on bent knee. At upper right, a haloed divine head emerges within red and blue drapery, gazing down. Both scenes are drawn with fine black ink outlines and flat color washes, with minimal hatching for drapery folds. Figure scale emphasizes the king over the commoner. Costume is unpatterned, conveying status via crown and color choice. Latin captions above and below frame the narrative, directly integrating text and image."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-register illumination of the Naboth episode reflects a mid-13th-century northern French workshop practice, likely produced in a monastic scriptorium for didactic use. The linear narrative sequence, rendered with minimal background and a restrained palette of vermillion, umber and shell gold, underscores the moral lesson of royal abuse and divine retribution. The professional Gothic textualis hand and precise ruling indicate a high-quality production aimed at educated clerics. Technically, the underdrawing and use of gesso for the crown detail reveal sophisticated material knowledge. Iconographically, the repetition of Ahab’s gestures and crown in both scenes creates a typological link between royal hubris and subsequent humility, emphasized by the divine head’s downward gaze. Comparatively, the flat washes and lack of spatial depth align with other works from the Parisian ‘Bible moralisée’ tradition, yet the simplicity of decorative framing suggests a more austere provincial adaptation. The illumination’s moral and political resonance would have served as a cautionary exemplar within monastic teaching, linking Old Testament kingship to contemporary ecclesiastical critiques of secular authority. Overall, the image negotiates tradition and innovation, combining standard iconographic types with economical composition to reinforce its didactic impact."

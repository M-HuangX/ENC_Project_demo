Christ wears a blue tunic with white mantle edged in gold; Peter’s green tunic and red mantle mirror the palette of the lower scene. The washbasin is a shallow bronze bowl with white lead highlights; a folded linen cloth is draped overhead. Figures overlap in two shallow registers, heads inclined inward around Christ. In the lower roundel, Christ sits centrally at a white‐draped table, wearing a blue mantle over red, his right hand raised in blessing, left hand on a dish. Apostles flank him in mirrored color arrangements; Judas is shown below the table receiving a sop on a paten. Table objects include four chalices in dark pigment, plates with bread, and bowls. Both scenes emphasize sacramental acts through focused gestures and repetitive compositional devices."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid‐13th‐century illumination likely originates in a northern French workshop—perhaps Paris or Soissons—where the rich palette of ultramarine, vermilion, and burnished gold reflects both access to luxury pigments and the growing emphasis on visual splendor in liturgical books. The two‐tiered roundel format recalls contemporaneous Psalters and medieval lectionaries, yet here the focus on Maundy Thursday rites—the Mandatum and the institution of the Eucharist—suggests a specialized liturgical companion for Holy Week. Stylistically, the confident underdrawing, raised gesso work beneath the gold, and the disciplined parchment preparation point to a high‐end atelier with multiple hands collaborating under a master illuminator. Iconographically, the images encapsulate sacramental theology: footwashing prefigures the humility of Christ’s sacrifice, while the lower scene enshrines the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Comparisons to the Winchester Bible and the Psalter of Blanche of Castile reveal shared graphic conventions—circular compartments, densely clustered apostles, and linear drapery patterning—yet this manuscript distinguishes itself in the rhythmic alternation of red and green robes and the unusually large washbasin motif. In sum, the illumination bridges Romanesque monumentality and emerging Gothic naturalism, serving both a devotional and didactic function within a liturgical context."

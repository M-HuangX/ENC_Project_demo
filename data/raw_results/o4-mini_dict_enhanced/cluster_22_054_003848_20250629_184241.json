The lion is rendered in blue-grey pigment with a stylized flowing mane, its head lowered onto the sheep’s back, which is depicted with fine white hatching to evoke wool. A solitary tree with a rounded trefoil crown stands at left, its trunk rising from the ground plane. To the right, a hooded man in a long, loose tunic raises both hands in alarm, one across his chest and one aloft, his face in three-quarter profile witnessing the act. Figures overlap: the lion’s body partially covers the sheep, and the man stands directly behind the lion, establishing spatial layering. The ground is a narrow blue band beneath the figures. The frame is a simple rectangular border edged in blue and white, punctuated by gold leaf squares at each corner."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This miniature likely originates from a 13th-century bestiary or moral treatise produced in a northern French workshop. The use of a mastic red background stippled with white, combined with burnished gold-leaf corner accents, reflects Parisian illumination conventions of the mid-1200s. Technically, the confident underdrawing and raised gesso beneath the gold indicate a skilled atelier, while the flat application of color and minimal shading align with the didactic clarity characteristic of bestiary imagery. Iconographically, the lion devouring a lamb serves a dual function: zoological description and moral allegory, warning against predatory vice. The lone witness—in simple secular dress—reinforces the allegory’s relevance to human behavior. The composition’s centralized arrangement and overlapping figures create an immediate visual hierarchy, emphasizing the dramatic action. Comparatively, this scene shares stylistic affinities with the Bestiary of Philippe de Thaon and the hybrid Anglo-Norman illumination style found in the Oxford Bestiary (Ashmolean MS. 1511), notably in the treatment of animal forms and decorative motifs. The image thus bridges tradition and innovation, combining established iconography with a refined color palette and framing devices that would influence later Gothic manuscript illumination."

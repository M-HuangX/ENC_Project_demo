      "scene_description": "The miniature depicts a single apocalyptic vision: at lower left stands Saint John the Evangelist, haloed, clad in a green mantle over a red tunic, hand to cheek in contemplative sorrow. Center right, an angel in white tunic balances on a rocky ledge, holding a chalice from which streams of vermilion blood fall diagonally to the lower right. In the upper register, a God-figure emerges from a cloud-wreathed Gothic micro-architecture, hands extended as if presenting the bowl to the angel. Below the blood flow, schematic city walls and fallen figures indicate the river turned to blood. The composition is organized in three vertical tiers—divine, angelic, terrestrial—linked by the diagonal trajectory of the liquid. Costume details include finely incised drapery folds, leaf-green cloak lined in pink, and an angel’s tunic rendered in white lead pigment. The rocky outcrop is washed in brown earth, and the diapered background of deep blue with gold dots unites the scene. The border’s red and white filigree frames the action, directing focus inward. The image conveys the third bowl of Revelation with clear theological symbolism and emotional intensity."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This illumination of the third bowl from the Apocalypse was likely produced in a high-quality Parisian workshop in the late 13th century, reflecting the growing interest in vividly illustrated eschatological texts among monastic and scholarly patrons. The hierarchical composition—God above, angel in mid-rank, and earthly consequences below—follows established iconographic conventions for Revelation scenes but is rendered with technical confidence: the use of ultramarine and burnished gold leaf underscores the sanctity of the heavenly realm, while vermilion red conveys the violence of divine judgement. The micro-architectural framing of the God-figure reveals familiarity with Gothic church forms, suggesting close collaboration between illuminator and architectonic draftsmen. The presence of underdrawing and gesso relief under gold points to sophisticated workshop practices, including multi-stage layering and collaborative hands. Iconographically, the scene emphasizes the transfer of divine authority via the bowl, linking Old Testament typology of plagues to New Testament prophecy. The image’s emotional tension—expressed in John’s sorrowful pose—mirrors contemporary devotional emphases on affective piety. Compared to English Channel School manuscripts, the precise linework and jewel-like palette here suggest a Paris workshop influenced by royal commissions, blending tradition with an intensified coloristic approach. This miniature thus exemplifies both the continuity and innovation of late 13th-century illumination, bridging doctrinal clarity and artistic elaboration."

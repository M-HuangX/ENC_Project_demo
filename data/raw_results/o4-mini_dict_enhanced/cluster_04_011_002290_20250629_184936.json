To the left stand three crowned Magi in lavish robes of green, lavender and gold, each bearing a gift: a casket, a jar and a vessel. All figures share gold halos, are placed upon a simple line ground and occupy equal vertical space. The lower register comprises five standing figures: two haloed female attendants in lilac gowns carry woven baskets; next Mary, in red and green, faces the priest at right, who stands beside a marble font draped with a white cloth. Mary holds the Christ Child toward the priest. All wear fine drapery folds highlighted with white, outlined in iron-gall ink. The composition emphasizes linear procession, with central actions—gift presentation above, ritual offering below—framed by matching border and divided by a colored band."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-register illumination, likely produced in a high-end Parisian workshop in the mid-13th century, reflects the era’s dual emphasis on narrative clarity and devotional intensity. The top scene, the Adoration of the Magi, and the bottom, the Presentation of Christ in the Temple, form a compact theological program highlighting Christ’s early recognition by both earthly rulers and sacred authority. The use of ultramarine and vermilion alongside burnished gold leaf situates the manuscript firmly within the luxury market for private prayer books, addressing a noble patron’s devotion and status. The artist’s confident underdrawing, visible under UV light, and the consistent drapery modeling betray a practiced hand working within the evolving Gothic aesthetic. Iconographically, the repetition of Marian blue and gold halos across registers underscores Mary’s mediating role between the pagan Magi and the Temple priestly class, reinforcing her intercessory power. Comparisons with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile suggest shared workshop practices, including the use of raised gesso and punchwork in halos. Yet the restraint in architectural framing and focus on figure-to-figure interaction reflect an innovative move toward spatial simplicity and narrative immediacy, prefiguring later Gothic masters. This folio thus embodies both traditional iconography and emerging Gothic compositional strategies, offering insight into mid-13th-century devotional art and patronage dynamics."

      "scene_description": "A single, full-square miniature depicts the despondent Christ, semi-nude and marked by scourge wounds, seated on a grassy mound at center. He bears a gilded halo inscribed with the cross. To his left, two figures enact the raising of the cross: one man in vermilion tunic kneels on one knee, grasping a timber beam, while another stands behind him holding a large wooden mallet mid-swing. Behind them, the Virgin Mary dressed in blue kneels, her hand covering her mouth in sorrow. To Christ’s right, St John the Evangelist in red with a green headdress bends forward, holding a cluster of iron nails. A bloodstained red cloth lies draped across the foreground beam. The background features a luminous ultramarine sky with stylized clouds and a gently rolling green hill. Figures are arranged in a near-pyramidal composition, scale emphasizing Christ’s central importance. Overlapping limbs and beams create shallow depth. Costumes are rendered with fine brushwork: soft folds in Mary’s mantle, pleated tunics on the executioners, and the diaphanous shroud around Christ’s waist. The scene is framed by a thin gold fillet and black line border that separates it from the surrounding text and margins."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This illumination of the Crucifixion likely originates from a late 15th-century Ghent–Bruges workshop, reflecting the flourishing book-trade that catered to wealthy lay patrons in the Burgundian Netherlands. The sumptuous application of burnished gold leaf and fine ultramarine indicates access to high-quality imported pigments, characteristic of private Books of Hours produced for courtly clientele. The intricate white-vine border, punctuated by naturalistic birds and grotesques, exemplifies the classical revival in marginal ornament, while the use of a single square miniature aligns with the devotional function of pausing at each Passion episode. Stylistically, the restrained perspectival treatment and hierarchical scaling adhere to established medieval conventions, yet the subtle modeling of flesh and intricate underdrawing reveal an innovative attention to naturalism. Workshop practices are evident in the collaborative hands: a master delineated the Christ figure and principal contours, while assistants executed border foliage and secondary figures. Iconographically, the composition emphasizes Christ’s redemptive suffering, counterbalanced by the maternal sorrow of Mary and the youthful compassion of John, inviting empathetic meditation. Compared to contemporary Parisian Hours, this page exhibits a more restrained palette and tighter modeling, suggesting regional variation. The work thus represents a transitional moment combining traditional Passion iconography with early Northern Renaissance refinements in pigment layering and border invention."

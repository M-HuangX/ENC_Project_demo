Pharaoh, seated on a cushioned throne with geometric ornament, wears a crown and voluminous draped cloak; his right hand is raised in address. Behind him stands Aaron in a long tunic with a patterned hem, holding a long staff vertically. The second scene below shows Moses at right, barefoot and clad in a flowing robe, grasping his staff horizontally as he gestures toward two banks of wavy lines representing parted waters. A group of Israelites, men and women in long robes and head coverings, stand behind him in overlapping profile views, some holding staffs. Ground is indicated by sparse stippling. Figures are drawn in clean profile or three-quarter views, with depth implied by overlapping and hierarchical placement rather than perspective. Both scenes employ minimal background, focusing on character actions and architectural or natural motifs rendered through fine pen lines and directional hatchwork."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "Produced in a major medieval scriptoria, this paired illustration set exemplifies the didactic programme of Old Testament manuscripts in the 12th–13th centuries. The top image, ‘Moses and Aaron before Pharaoh,’ emphasizes divine authority through architectural framing and regal posture, reflecting liturgical emphasis on prophetic intercession. The lower scene, ‘Moses Parting the Red Sea,’ continues the narrative with stark line drawings that focus on gesture and crowd movement rather than elaborate background, a hallmark of transitional Romanesque-Gothic illumination. The monochrome facsimile highlights the underlying compositional strategies: overlapping figures to suggest depth, repetition of drapery patterns for visual unity, and the use of repeated staff and gesture motifs to link episodes. Technically, the original vellum support and quill-pen underdrawing reveal professional workshop practices, likely associated with a cathedral school. Iconographically, the juxtaposition of confrontation and deliverance serves both theological and political messages, paralleling the resistance of earthly authority with divine intervention—an analogy that would have resonated in contemporary ecclesiastical contexts. Comparatively, these scenes share stylistic affinities with the Bury Bible’s clear contours and the Winchester Psalter’s narrative clarity, situating the manuscript firmly within the pan-European Romanesque revival while anticipating more naturalistic Gothic tendencies."

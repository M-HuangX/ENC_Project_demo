On the left stands a nobleman, wearing a long purple tunic trimmed with ermine, red striped sleeves, hose and black pointed shoes. Beside him, a lady in a brown-ochre gown and dark green mantle; her white veil frames a composed expression as she gently takes the nobleman’s hand and extends her other arm in a decisive pointing gesture toward a third figure. To the right, a youthful courtier in a rose-red cote with black-spotted collar, matching hood and purple hose holds a slender staff; his posture is deferential, weight on one leg. The ground is pinkish, dotted with irregular stones and tufts of grass; a low fence and behind it a row of stylized trees form the mid- and background. Figures overlap slightly, creating shallow depth; scale is roughly uniform. Clothing details—ermine spots, folded sleeves, visible garment seams—indicate social rank and material richness."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This miniature likely originates from a late 15th-century court workshop producing vernacular romances in northern France or the Burgundian Netherlands. The use of Gothic bastarda script and the choice of Old French text align with manuscripts commissioned by lay patrons keen on courtly narratives. Stylistically, the precise quill outlining and restrained palette reflect workshop practices favoring clarity over opulence; pigments such as vermillion and verdigris suggest access to imported materials but no extensive use of gold, indicating a balance between luxury and economy. The triangular composition and horizontal gesture recall earlier Miniature trends in Parisian ateliers, yet the simplified background fence and tree-line underscore a regional adaptation toward a more naturalistic setting. Iconographically, the lady’s pointing gesture and the courtier’s staff may allude to themes of command and service in courtly love, a common trope in secular literature of the period. Comparatively, this scene shares affinities with illustrations in the Roman de la Rose manuscript traditions, though it adapts them through a more subdued color harmony and spatial arrangement. Technically, the absence of gesso and gold leaf distinguishes it from high-luxury books of hours, suggesting a specialized workshop with an eye toward narrative clarity. This miniature thus embodies both continuity with established Parisian illumination conventions and regional innovations in composition and palette."

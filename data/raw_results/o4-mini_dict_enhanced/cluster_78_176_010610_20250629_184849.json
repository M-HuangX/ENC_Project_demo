      "scene_description": "A single liturgical miracle scene: in the upper register, Christ stands behind an altar-table adorned with patterned cloth, holding a paten upon which a radiant, severed head—the manifestation of the consecrated Host—rests. He raises his right hand in benediction. Flanking him in a semi-circle are six haloed clerics or bishops, each in liturgical vestments, turned inward to witness the marvel. In the lower register, Saint Gregory kneels centrally before the altar, hands raised in awe, his face uplifted toward the miraculous head. Gregory wears a red cope and blue dalmatic, denoting his papal office but bears no halo. The table is laden with chalices, flagons and bowls, all rendered in burnished gold and white highlights. Figures display individualized facial types—long beards on older clerics, curly hair on younger—while drapery is crisply folded, with white edging highlighting the forms. Spatially, the scene is compressed into two horizontal bands, the heavenly vision above and the earthly recipient below. The composition uses hierarchical scale: Christ and his head are largest, the kneeling Gregory slightly smaller, and the witnessing clerics recede. Decorative Gothic arches enclose the assembly, reinforcing the sacred setting."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This illumination of the Mass of Saint Gregory was likely produced in a northern French workshop circa 1250–1270, at a moment when Eucharistic devotion and the doctrine of transubstantiation were being vigorously promulgated. The architectural framing in miniature Gothic arches and the lavish use of ultramarine and gold reflect a high-status commission, perhaps for a cathedral treasury or a noble patron’s chapel. Stylistically, the crisp penwork and restrained modeling of drapery connect to the Parisian school, while the presence of multiple clerical witnesses suggests a collaborative workshop accustomed to large liturgical books. Technically, the raised gesso and punchwork under the gold leaf demonstrate a sophisticated use of precious materials to heighten the miraculous nature of the image. Iconographically, the severed yet living head on the paten embodies the late medieval emphasis on the corporeal reality of Christ in the sacrament. The kneeling Gregory, unhaled, underlines the human reception of divine mystery. Comparatively, this scene shares compositional elements with other mid-thirteenth-century missals illuminated in the Île-de-France, while its detailed underdrawing and border architecture anticipate the later Gothic revival in manuscript illumination. Overall, the miniature marries doctrinal urgency with refined artistic practice, exemplifying the period’s intersection of theology and courtly visual culture."

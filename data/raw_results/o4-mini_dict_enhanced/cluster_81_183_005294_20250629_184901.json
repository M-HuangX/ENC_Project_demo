Three figures occupy the space: on the left, a crowned king clad in ultramarine blue cloak over a vermilion tunic sits on a gilded throne with matching footstool. He extends his right hand in a pointing gesture and holds the upper edge of a parchment charter, whose lower edge bears a round pendent seal showing a rampant lion. Kneeling to the right of the throne, a young nobleman in a long red robe gazes up respectfully and holds the charter with both hands. Behind him stands an attendant in a green gown, right hand raised in acquiescence and left hand resting on the noble’s shoulder, indicating support. The throne’s elevation and gold frame emphasize the monarch’s preeminence. The floor is decorated with alternating pink and red tiles bearing black diaper motifs. Above the figures float a steel helmet with green-tipped black feather crest and, to its right, a heraldic shield (blue field, black reeds on a sable chief) signifying the petitioner’s lineage. Decorative border and armorial devices reinforce the legal and dynastic context of this investiture ceremony."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This miniature likely originates from a late 13th- or early 14th-century French chancery or court workshop, produced under a royal patron’s direction to record and legitimize feudal grants. The emphasis on burnished gold, ultramarine and vermilion reflects high material investment, underscoring the political significance of the charter presentation. The heraldic device—blue field charged with reeds—and corresponding helmet crest situate the petitioner within a specific noble lineage, while the king’s elevated throne and pointing gesture reinforce monarchical authority. Stylistically, the crisp outlines, minimal shading and formalized floor diaper pattern align with the mature Gothic illumination traditions of Paris and the Île-de-France region, though the simplified drapery may indicate a provincial atelier influenced by the Channel School. Underdrawing visible under UV suggests planning by a master illuminator, with execution by assistants in color application. Iconographically, the scene asserts the reciprocal bond of fealty and royal favor, serving both documentary and propagandistic functions. Compared to contemporaneous manuscripts such as the Liber Regalis or regional cartularies, this image integrates narrative naturalism with heraldic clarity, merging traditional investiture iconography with distinctive armorial display. The work thus embodies the intersection of legal record, visual diplomacy and courtly art practice in medieval France."

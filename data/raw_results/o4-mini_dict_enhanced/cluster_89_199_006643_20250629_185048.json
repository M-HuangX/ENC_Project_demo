One attendant supports her head on a white pillow while another gently touches her forehead. Overlapping figures and a single ground line suggest limited depth. Drapery folds are rendered through parallel brushstrokes with subtle white highlights. The noblewoman’s linen headdress and the attendants’ simple veils reflect mid-14th-century courtly fashion. Gold leaf outlines the halos and decorative frame, contrasting against a solid green background. The grouping is balanced horizontally, and gestures cluster toward the unseen saint off-frame, emphasizing human response to divine intervention. The composition’s focus on the patient and attendants, framed by a simple blue border, underscores the miracle’s central action without ancillary ornament."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This four-panel miniature cycle likely originates from a mid-14th-century French workshop, crafted for monastic or cathedral use in sermon preparation. The judicious deployment of ultramarine and burnished gold, along with the precise Gothic textura script, indicates a high-status commission funded by an ecclesiastical patron. The narrative sequence aligns with the homiletic tradition, illustrating stages of healing, episcopal recognition, martyrdom, and posthumous intercession—core exempla for preaching on sanctity and ecclesial authority. Stylistic affinities with English Channel illumination are apparent in the elongated figure types and diapered backgrounds, suggesting cross-Channel artistic exchange. Technical examination under ultraviolet light reveals confident underdrawing and a layered pigment application, with white highlights added to accentuate drapery volumes. Iconographically, the prominence of the mitred bishop and crozier underscores the church’s mediating role between the divine and laity. The compartmentalized grid layout, rather than lavish marginalia, emphasizes textual integration and narrative clarity, supporting its didactic function. Comparative cycles in the Legenda Aurea manuscripts of the Bibliothèque nationale share similar compositional frameworks but often feature more ornate architectural frames; this example’s restraint indicates a purposeful focus on content utility over opulent display. Overall, the folio exemplifies the interplay of pedagogy, devotion, and artistic refinement in mid-14th-century devotional manuscripts."

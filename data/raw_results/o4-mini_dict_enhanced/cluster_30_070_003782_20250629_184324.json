He holds a crozier in his left hand and places a ring or baton on the right hand of a kneeling layman dressed in a blue surcoat over chain mail. To the bishop’s right, three clerics in red and blue albs look on; to his left, two armed knights stand with visored helmets and swords. The upper scene background is patterned in burnished gold and ultramarine diaper, and the floor is black with white highlights. Below, a two-storey castle façade with twin round towers rises from a green-blue river. Inside the lower register’s three compartments, small figures enact domestic or administrative activities: a scribe at a desk, a steward weighing coin, and a seated figure in council. To the right, a boat drifts on the water with a reclining passenger. All figures are drawn with fine line work, their garments articulated by white highlights and minimal hatching."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This richly illuminated page, opening the Psalter with the large initials “PS,” was likely produced in a high‐end Paris workshop around 1320–1330, reflecting the height of Gothic illumination in northern France. Its combination of hierarchical composition, sumptuous ultramarine and gold, and delicate foliate marginalia aligns with the Deux Ponts corpus, which catered to aristocratic patrons seeking both devotional functionality and visual spectacle. The investiture scene foregrounds the intersection of ecclesiastical and secular power: the bishop bestows authority on a kneeling layman, reinforcing the mutual reinforcement of religious sanction and feudal hierarchy. Architecturally, the depiction of a two‐storey crenellated castle with interior vignettes underscores the era’s interest in realistic settings, even within the flat pictorial space governed by hierarchical scaling. Technically, the use of raised gesso beneath gold leaf and finely stippled punchwork reveals a collaborative workshop employing multiple hands—likely a master illuminator for figures and a specialist for borders. Iconographically, the absence of overt biblical reference transforms the Psalter frontispiece into a statement of patronal identity, marrying personal commemoration with liturgical purpose. Comparative analysis with the Épinal and Paris Master of the Bible Historiale suggests shared stylistic traits—particularly in facial types and drapery treatment—yet this page exhibits unique innovations in register layering and narrative integration. Thus, the illumination navigates between traditional devotional imagery and emerging courtly tastes, embodying the transitional aesthetics of early 14th‐century Parisian illumination."

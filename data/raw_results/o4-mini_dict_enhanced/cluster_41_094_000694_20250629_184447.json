Facing him is an enthroned saint-king, seated on a high-backed throne with cushion, wearing a long tunic and mantle draped over one shoulder, his head crowned and his right hand raised in blessing. The king’s larger scale emphasizes his authority. Both figures are rendered in precise, consistent iron-gall ink lines, with minimal internal hatching. In the right panel, four male pilgrims walk toward the right margin in single file. Each wears a long cloak over a tunic, pointed shoes, and a hat; they carry long staffs. The first pilgrim’s forward step and the tilt of his body create directional flow. Overlapping of their cloaks establishes slight depth. Both panels lack background details, focusing attention on figures and narrative action. The rectangular framing unifies the two scenes, while the partition reinforces their sequential relationship."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-panel pen drawing likely originates from a mid-13th-century hagiographic roll or codex produced in a northern French workshop known for its economical iron-gall ink illustrations. The reduced palette and reliance on crisp line work point to an audience valuing textual content over lavish color, perhaps a monastic community copying a collection of royal saint miracles—most plausibly those of Edward the Confessor, given the Old French verses at left. The composition employs linear narrative: a kneeling supplicant pleads for intercession before an enthroned saint-king, followed by a procession of pilgrims, suggesting the aftermath of a miracle inspiring pilgrimage. Stylistically, the work shows continuity with English Channel School manuscripts in its elongated figures and hatching in drapery folds, yet the framing and textual integration resemble Parisian workshop practices of the 1240s–1250s. Iconographically, the crowned figure’s blessing gesture and the subsequent pilgrims underscore themes of royal sanctity and popular devotion. Compared with contemporaneous manuscripts such as the Évreux Pontifical, this drawing is more austere but equally effective in guiding the viewer’s devotional focus. Its modest technical execution belies its rich devotional function, bridging textual narrative and visual exhortation to pilgrimage."

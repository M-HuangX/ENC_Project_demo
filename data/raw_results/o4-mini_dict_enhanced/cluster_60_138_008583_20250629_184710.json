      "scene_description": "Within the bordered miniature, nine figures enact a coronation: a central nobleman kneels before a standing bishop wearing a mitre and alb. The bishop holds a gilded chrism vessel in his left hand and raises his right in blessing. To the left, six courtiers stand in a line—two closest present a gold crown held on a cloth, one behind bears a sheathed sword, others watch in ceremonial garb. All wear long hair and contemporary robes strewn with gold fleur-de-lis, except one in solid red. The scene unfolds on a red-and-white lozenge-tiled floor against a blue and gold diapered field. Behind the bishop, a marble throne with pinnacles and red drapery frames the ritual, emphasizing ecclesiastical authority. \n\nThe spatial arrangement is strictly planar: the kneeling figure occupies the foreground center, flanked by crown-bearers on the left and the bishop on the right. Overlapping limbs suggest minimal depth. Robes are painted in ultramarine with gold motifs; folds receive white highlights. The crown’s rich gilding and the bishop’s ornate mitre draw the eye to the central act of investiture. A red canopy and patterned border underscore the solemnity of the ceremony, while the absence of naturalistic landscape focuses attention on the symbolic transfer of royal power."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This crown­ing scene, executed in a mid-14th-century French workshop, reflects the intertwining of secular and ecclesiastical authority in royal investiture. The use of ultramarine and burnished gold leaf underscores the monarchy’s divine sanction, while the fleur-de-lis motif visually asserts French royal identity. The collaborative production—evident in slight variations of drapery handling and facial types—suggests multiple hands in a court atelier. Technically, the layered pigments with white lead highlights and the gesso-raised gold demonstrate advanced material mastery, likely influenced by Parisian illumination practices. Iconographically, the bishop’s central role and the coronation act mirror contemporaneous chronicles that legitimize the crown through sacramental ritual. The flat decorative background and stylized floor, common to the International Gothic style, prioritize symbolic clarity over naturalistic space. Comparatively, the miniature resonates with the Grandes Chroniques de France in its ceremonial emphasis but diverges in its intimate scale and refined detailing, pointing to a specialized commission for a duchy or ecclesiastical institution. It exemplifies a transitional moment when personal devotional imagery and official historical narrative merged, serving both as a political assertion of royal power and as a visual memory aid for clerical or noble audiences within institutional settings."

Flanking him are two attendants in plain tunics; one gestures toward the rack while another stands behind. The ruler’s curly hair and gold crown distinguish him; his blue-tinged tunic is richly decorated. To the right of this group, a row of five clerics in simple robes awaits judgment. In the second scene on the right, an executioner in a plain tunic grips a victim’s head with one hand and raises a sword with the other, poised for decapitation. Before him kneel two tonsured clerics in long liturgical robes, hands clasped in prayer. A small pile of severed heads at his feet mirrors the rack in the first scene. The two crowned figures are slightly larger than the kneeling clerics, indicating hierarchical importance. The victims’ robes show minimal decoration but have narrow hems; the executioner’s posture is bent forward at a sharp angle, emphasizing the violent act."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-scene illustration likely originates from a 10th–11th century monastic martyrology produced in a Northern French scriptorium. The use of gold leaf for the ruler’s crown and execution poles aligns with the Romanesque revival of precious materials to convey hierarchical importance. The Carolingian minuscule script with rubrication suggests a transitional hand contemporary with Ottonian workshops, where text and image were coordinated to serve both liturgical recitation and mnemonic functions. The sequential layout—first the sovereign’s judgment, then the martyrdom—reflects a pedagogical intent, guiding the viewer through the narrative in a single register without architectural framing, in keeping with early Romanesque austerity. The iconography emphasizes the tension between secular authority and ecclesiastical victimhood, underlining the theme of steadfast faith in the face of persecution. Artistically, the execution of flat color areas and minimal shading indicates a workshop still rooted in linear Insular traditions, even as the use of ultramarine foreshadows later Gothic sophistication. Comparisons with the Tours School's martyrologies reveal shared figure types and rubric conventions, though this example’s sparing palette and unadorned background mark it as an earlier, more ascetic prototype. The image serves not only to commemorate the martyrs but also to reinforce monastic ideals of obedience and divine vindication, linking local practice to universal hagiographic models."

Central horse and rider face left, the knight raising a sword in his right hand and grasping reins in his left. To his left, a second knight lowers a lance aimed at the central figure; his pennoned lance overlaps the central knight’s helmet. Behind them stand three auxiliary chevaliers: two in full helm and one bareheaded figure wearing a simple crown and long red robe, holding horse reins. The white warhorse of the central knight is caparisoned with blue and gold fringed harness, its saddlecloth edged with fleur-de-lis motifs in shell gold. The riders wear full plate armor with blue-edged surcoats bearing heraldic devices in red and gold. Grass blades and stylized bushes cover the foreground; a gently rolling hill and a trio of tufted trees occupy the midground, beneath an ultramarine sky. Figures are arranged in overlapping tiers: the central combatants in the lower register, the observers elevated slightly to the right. Armor surfaces show fine hatching; lances and swords are rendered with metallic silver tones. The red and green robes of the onlookers contrast with the cool palette of armor and landscape, reinforcing the hierarchy of active and passive participants."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This miniature likely originates from a late 14th-century Franco-Burgundian workshop, reflecting the era’s fusion of chivalric narrative and courtly display. The professional Gothic textura script and lavish ultramarine and gold point to a high-status commission, perhaps for a princely patron keen to perpetuate martial values. The centralization of the mounted combatants underscores the knightly ethos, while the careful overlapping of figures and limited landscape evoke emerging concerns with spatial coherence in Burgundian illumination. The color hierarchy—blue for active protagonists, red and green for passive observers—reinforces narrative focus and social distinction. Technically, the use of gesso relief beneath gold and fine hatching on armor reveals sophisticated studio practice, comparable to illuminations in the Chronicles of Froissart. Iconographically, the fleur-de-lis motifs situate the scene within a royal context, suggesting a parallel between fictional or historical combat and dynastic legitimacy. Compared with contemporaneous works from the Parisian atelier of the Rohan Master, this image shares a dynamic diagonal thrust and naturalistic foliage, while diverging in its more subdued depth treatment. Overall, the miniature bridges traditional manuscript iconography and the evolving pictorial ambitions of late medieval courtly art."

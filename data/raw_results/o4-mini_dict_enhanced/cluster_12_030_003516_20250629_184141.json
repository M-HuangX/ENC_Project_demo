To the left stand three ecclesiastics: the foremost wears the papal tiara and raises a coronet above the seated figure’s head; behind him two assistants in plain mitres observe. On the right are three lay witnesses in plain grey cloaks, grouped closely, their hands raised in gesture of obeisance. The figures occupy a patterned blue ground with red and white dots, enclosed in a gold quatrefoil frame. Spatially, the central figure is largest, flanked symmetrically by smaller standing figures. The gestures—papal hand lifting the crown, witnesses’ raised hands—drive the action. The seated figure’s mantle shows layered grey washes and white highlights, indicating a fine wool or cloth-of-silver fabric. The tiara’s jewels are indicated by minute red and blue dots, the lion bench signals authority. Surrounding vine scrolls in the margin echo the patterning within the miniature, linking text and image."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "Created in a mid-14th-century French court workshop, this illumination exemplifies the International Gothic style adapted for a secular chronicle. The rich application of ultramarine and burnished gold, combined with intricate punch-work, signals a high-status patron—likely a duke asserting his right to investiture. The centralized composition and hierarchical scaling underscore the pope’s superior authority even as he vests secular power. Vine-scroll marginalia link the ceremonial scene to the surrounding text, reinforcing the narrative of feudal legitimation. Technically, the use of underdrawing, layered washes, and white lead highlights demonstrates sophisticated studio practice. The patterned blue ground and quatrefoil frame derive from Parisian illumination models, suggesting influence from the Royal atelier. Iconographically, the triple tiara and lion-headed bench evoke papal supremacy and the continuity of Roman tradition, while the kneeling figure’s simple crown and mantle emphasize ducal humility before the Church. Comparatively, the scene resonates with contemporary depictions in the Grandes Chroniques de France but stands out for its intimate scale and refined execution. This miniature thus bridges narrative clarity with decorative elegance, reflecting both political propaganda and evolving aesthetic tastes of the late Middle Ages."

The presence of a bishop performing a liturgical act suggests its use for ceremonial or memory aid purposes. Significant use of gold and the inclusion of a crowned figure highlights its status as a luxury item, commissioned possibly by a noble figure. The artistic style aligns with the Gothic tradition, characterized by hierarchical composition and vibrant color application, ensuring clear visual storytelling in a religious context. The quality of execution indicates professional craftsmanship likely connected to a well-established scriptorium, reflecting the cultural and spiritual priorities of the period."

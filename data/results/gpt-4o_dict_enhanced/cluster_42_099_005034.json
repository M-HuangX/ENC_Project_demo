    "scholarly_interpretation": "This manuscript likely originates from a high-quality workshop, potentially in France, during the late 14th or early 15th century. Its dual function as a religious and political document reflects the close interplay between church and state during this period. The use of luxurious materials like gold leaf and high-quality vellum suggests it was commissioned by or for a patron of significant wealth and status, likely a member of the nobility or a high-ranking ecclesiastic. The vibrant use of color and gold emphasizes the manuscript's role as a display object, likely intended to convey messages of divine favor and royal legitimacy. Artistically, the manuscript displays characteristics of the International Gothic style, with intricate detailing, dynamic figures, and a lack of perspective in favor of a more hierarchical composition. The iconography connects contemporary political power to divine authority, a common theme in medieval hagiographic texts. Comparatively, this manuscript shares stylistic similarities with other French hagiographies of the time, such as the 'Golden Legend,' emphasizing its role as both a spiritual guide and a political tool."

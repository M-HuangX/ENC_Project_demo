This form of visual storytelling is a crucial resource for understanding medieval perceptions of power and hierarchy. The linen and wool medium highlights the practicality and durability desired for such a tapestry, ensuring its preservation over centuries. This work stands as an exemplar of medieval narrative artistry, intertwining political, historical, and artistic threads in a singular cultural artifact."

Created for liturgical use by a monastic community, its primary function was likely to serve as a visual mnemonic device, enhancing monastic reading and instruction with engaging paleo-Christian imagery. The composition reflects early medieval artistic traditions, employing hierarchical scaling and line work typical of illustrations from this period. While the palette is limited to monochrome, the artist skillfully conveys depth and meaning through composition and figural interactions. Images blend seamlessly with the text, reinforcing narrative continuity and religious messaging. Such manuscripts offer valuable insights into early medieval iconographic conventions and their role in religious and educational life."

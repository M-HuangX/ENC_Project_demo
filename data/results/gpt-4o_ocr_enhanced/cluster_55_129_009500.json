The sequential arrangement of scenes reflects the manuscript's didactic purpose, instructing viewers in biblical stories through visual cues and textual references. The use of Caroline Minuscule indicates a time when clarity of script was paramount for educational texts. Limited coloring and reliance on line work suggest a pragmatic approach to manuscript decoration. The straightforward composition supports direct engagement with biblical themes, aligning with contemporary monastic and ecclesiastical reforms emphasizing scriptural literacy. This work shares stylistic elements with similar manuscripts from the early Gothic period, emphasizing narrative clarity over ornamental complexity."

The detailed initials and use of gold indicate not only aesthetic considerations but also convey religious and educational purposes. The consistent thematic elements and stylistic choices align with other hagiographic manuscripts of the period, indicating its function as both a devotional object and a status symbol. The integration of text and image demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of narrative illustration, part of the broader trend towards personalized religious texts in the late medieval period."

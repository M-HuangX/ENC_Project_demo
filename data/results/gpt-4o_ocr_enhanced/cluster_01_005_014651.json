Such manuscripts were often designed not only for reading but as status symbols, showcasing the wealth and refined taste of the owner. The secular theme, while rare, suggests a commission specifically tailored for a noble audience interested in literature, history, or symbolic storytelling. The animal's inclusion provides a playful touch, reflecting a courtly ethos where humor intermingled with gravitas. Overall, the manuscript is a testament to the multifaceted roles of texts in medieval society, serving educational, devotional, and entertainment purposes. Its high preservation state allows for a continued appreciation of the meticulous hand-craftsmanship and the visual strategies employed to engage a medieval audience."

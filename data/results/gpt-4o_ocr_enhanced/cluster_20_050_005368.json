    "scholarly_interpretation": "This section of the Bayeux Tapestry illustrates a crucial moment in the events leading to the Norman Conquest of England, believed to have been commissioned by Bishop Odo, William the Conqueror's half-brother. The tapestry is thought to have been produced in the late 11th century, likely in an English workshop skilled in embroidery, as evidenced by the Anglo-Saxon embroidery techniques visible in the surviving sections. The scene focuses on Harold, marching to confront the French across the river, reflecting the militaristic and ideological propaganda intended to justify and commemorate William's conquest. The stylistic approach maintains the narrative clarity through continuous horizontal movement and a simplified visual language that emphasizes the linear progression of historical events. The use of vivid woolen threads, albeit slightly faded, contributes to the scene's boldly outlined visual hierarchy, essential for its original function as a visually accessible storytelling medium intended to communicate to observers in a largely illiterate society. This artefact holds significant value in its blending of art and history, demonstrating both cultural interactions and the socio-political objectives of the Norman elite during the aftermath of the conquest."

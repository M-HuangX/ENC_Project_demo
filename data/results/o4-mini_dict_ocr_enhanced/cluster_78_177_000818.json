      "scene_description": "In the upper roundel Christ, identifiable by his nimbus and central placement, kneels before an apostle seated on a low bench. He holds the disciple’s right foot over a shallow basin, pouring water from a jug held in his left hand. The seated apostle inclines, his green robe and red undergarment articulated with white highlights. Eleven additional apostles stand behind in semicircular grouping, their varied hair and beard patterns meticulously delineated in brown ink and white lead. The draped red curtain behind suggests an inner room. Feet rest on a footstool and the basin rim is gilded. The spatial arrangement is shallow: overlapping figures create depth, but all are nearly equal in scale, emphasizing communal unity. Each apostle’s tunic and cloak reveal lapis lazuli and vermilion layering techniques. The decorative frame of scrolling acanthus leaves in blue, red, green, and gold punctuated with white dots encloses the scene. Compositionally, the viewer’s eye is drawn from Christ’s bowed figure through the circle of apostles to the lifted hand of one disciple at the back."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This full-page double-roundel illumination likely originates from a mid-13th-century French liturgical manuscript, possibly produced in a Parisian workshop under royal patronage. The pairing of the Mandatum and Last Supper reflects the liturgical emphasis on Maundy Thursday rites and underscores the theological link between Christ’s humility and the institution of the Eucharist. The use of sumptuous ultramarine and burnished gold leaf, alongside precise quill underdrawing and gesso relief, signals a high-quality production intended for an elite ecclesiastical audience. The balanced two-tier grid composition demonstrates an innovative yet tradition-rooted approach to narrative display, while the continuous acanthus border reflects evolving Gothic decorative conventions. Iconographically, the juxtaposition of foot washing and the eucharistic meal conveys a programmatic message of service preceding sacramental unity, aligning with Cistercian and Dominican devotional currents of the period. Comparative analysis reveals affinities with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile in palette and execution, suggesting shared workshop practices or itinerant illuminators. This illumination thus embodies the intersection of liturgical function, technical mastery, and sophisticated iconographic design characteristic of high medieval manuscript art."

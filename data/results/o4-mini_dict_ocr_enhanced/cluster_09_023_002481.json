All wear long tunics with vermilion and ultramarine overdrapes; Mary’s mantle is deep blue edged with gold punchwork. Christ is distinguished by a cruciform halo. The figures are arranged in a shallow stage-like space indicated by a narrow red floor band and stylized architectural arcade overhead. Overlapping drapery folds, white highlights, and varying line weight model form. The gold ground is stippled to catch light. Attendant figures are scaled slightly smaller, emphasizing central placement of Mary and Christ. A decorated Gothic arch frames the scene, with crocketed pinnacles and miniature tracery. A vine-scroll border in the outer margin surrounds both text and image, integrating decorative and narrative elements. Liturgical vessels on the table foreshadow the Eucharistic significance. This compositional focus on table and gesture underlines the miracle’s theological import and visually anchors the scene within the cycle."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "Produced in a Parisian workshop circa 1250–1275, this cycle of eight miracles of Christ exemplifies the pedagogical illumination tradition emerging in the high Gothic era. The artist’s rigorous grid structure and uniform roundels reflect a didactic program, likely commissioned by a cathedral school for theological instruction. The use of burnished gold leaf backgrounds and ultramarine blue—imported at great expense—signals both ecclesiastical prestige and devotional intensity. The patterned dark-blue fields and quatrefoil links between roundels recall contemporary stained-glass design, suggesting cross-media influence within Paris’s vibrant visual culture. Technically, the manuscript demonstrates advanced layering of pigments over gesso, white-lead highlighting, and underdrawing, indicating a mature studio practice with multiple hands collaborating under a master illuminator. Iconographically, the cycle pairs Eucharistic and healing miracles to underscore Christ’s dual role as healer and sacramental host. The central table motif in the Wedding at Cana echoes the altar in the Feeding of the Multitude, forging typological links. Comparisons with the Morgan Picture Bible and the early Psalter of Blanche of Castile reveal similar micro-architectural framing and color harmonies, situating this manuscript within a network of high-status Parisian commissions. Its blend of scholastic clarity and ornate decor embodies the transitional moment when manuscript illumination served both educational and devotional functions in Gothic society."

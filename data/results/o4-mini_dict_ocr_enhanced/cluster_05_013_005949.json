At center, the carved marble font stands beneath a blue and gold fleur-de-lis canopy. The bishop, vested in green and white with a gold-lined cope, holds his crosier in his left hand and extends his right over the water. To his right, two acolytes in white robes hold a ewer and pour water into the font. Three infants in white gowns kneel before the font. To the left, a crowned queen in a blue robe with gold fleur-de-lis and ermine trim stands holding her son’s hand, flanked by noble attendants in white albs. Behind the bishop, four clerics in white vestments observe. The scene is symmetrically arranged, with overlapping figures and a tiled floor suggesting a shallow interior. The damask wall hanging and canopy frame the action, while narrow windows reveal a distant castle and rolling hills. Secondary decorative features include the red patterned background, the ornamental initial in the text, and the simple border emphasizing the pictorial compartment."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This manuscript leaf, executed in a high-quality Parisian workshop ca. 1380–1400, belongs to a vernacular collection of saints’ lives designed for private devotion by a noble patron. The use of ultramarine and burnished gold, combined with fine Gothic textura, reflects a courtly milieu and substantial financial investment. The central miniature of Saint Amant’s baptism, set beneath a fleur-de-lis canopy, visually parallels royal patronage with sanctified authority, reinforcing dynastic legitimacy through hagiographic narrative. Stylistically, the panel shows the influence of the Rouen school in its delicate grisaille shading and ornamental patterning of draperies, while its architectural framing and damask background recall manuscripts produced for Charles V’s court. Iconographically, the scene emphasizes the sanctity of baptism as the gateway to divine favor, with the queen’s presence underscoring the intercessionary role of the laity in saintly cult. Comparisons with the Psalter of Jean de Berry reveal similar color palettes and canopy motifs, suggesting shared pigment sources and workshop practices. Technically, the visible gesso relief and underdrawing illustrate advanced layering methods and collaborative authorship by specialist illuminators and scribes. This leaf exemplifies the blend of tradition and innovation characteristic of late 14th-century Parisian illumination, marrying devotional function with courtly display."

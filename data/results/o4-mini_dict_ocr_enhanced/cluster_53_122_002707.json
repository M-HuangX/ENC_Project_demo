      "scene_description": "The illumination depicts seven figures: Christ to the right, barefoot on a green hillock, wearing a red mantle over an ochre tunic and a cruciform gold halo. His right hand is raised in benediction, his left holds a white scroll inscribed in brown ink. Behind him stands a semicircle of five apostles in tunics of blue, green, and white with red mantles, each with smaller gold halos and outlined in brown. At the lower center, the hemorrhaging woman kneels on one knee, leaning forward to touch Christ’s hem; she wears a brown hooded mantle over a beige tunic. The stylized ground consists of undulating mounds with red-flowered sprigs, and the background is a deep blue sky dotted with white stars. Spatially, Christ’s larger scale emphasizes divinity, while overlapping figures suggest shallow depth. Secondary elements include the double-rule red border, the starlit background signifying the celestial realm, and scroll banners linking speaker and petition. Symbolic components are the burnished halos denoting sanctity, Christ’s gesture of authority, and the woman’s humble posture expressing faith. The composition focuses on the diagonal interaction between Christ’s hand and the woman’s touch, directing the viewer’s eye across the scene."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This illumination of Christ healing the woman with the hemorrhage was likely produced in a mid-13th-century French workshop, reflecting the era’s emphasis on vivid narrative imagery to accompany Gospel texts. The use of ultramarine and vermilion indicates access to costly pigments, while the professional Gothic textura script and precise rubrication suggest a commission for a high-status ecclesiastical setting, perhaps a cathedral chapter. Artistically, the scene demonstrates the transitional move from flat, stylized figures toward a more naturalistic representation, seen in the subtle overlapping to imply depth and the careful modeling of drapery folds with white highlights. The application of gesso beneath the halos and punchwork details align with contemporary Parisian illumination techniques. Iconographically, the composition underscores Christ’s authority and the power of faith: his hierarchical scale and extended benedictory hand contrast with the woman’s humble posture, reinforcing theological themes of divine mercy. The starlit sky and floral ground serve as symbolic markers of the cosmic and earthly realms. Comparatively, this scene shares stylistic affinities with the Bible moralisée of the Royal Library in Paris, yet its restrained border decoration suggests a different patron’s preference. Overall, the leaf illustrates the synergy of liturgical function, artistic innovation, and theological messaging characteristic of high Gothic manuscript culture."

To his left stands the Agnus Dei, bearing the cross‐banner. Christ is clad in a red tunic and blue mantle, haloed and set within a burnished gold mandorla dotted with small gold points. Surrounding him on either side are six angels on the upper tier, wings outstretched and hands raised in adoration, wearing alternating red and green robes with white stoles. On the middle tier two larger kneeling angels incline toward the viewer, their scroll banners inscribed with Latin praise formulas winding outward. The lowest tier features twelve Elders of the Apocalypse, barefoot and vested in long stoles over white albs; each raises both hands in worship. The background is a deep ultramarine diaper pattern. The border comprises a pinkish‐beige chevron frame edged by white vine scroll on a pink ground. Symbolic components include the mandorla (glory), the lamb (Agnus Dei), and textual scrolls emphasizing themes of salvation, blessing, and power."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This illumination of Christ in Majesty flanked by the Lamb and adoring angels and elders conforms closely to Revelation 4 iconography popular in mid-13th-century Parisian workshops. The use of ultramarine blue diaper background with white filigree and burnished gold mandorla suggests access to high-value pigments, indicating a wealthy patron, likely commissioning a deluxe Apocalypse or Book of Hours. Stylistically, the crisp, uniform line work and precise figural modeling reflect a professional atelier versed in the Gothic style of northern France; the balanced symmetry and hierarchical scaling underline the theological emphasis on divine order. Technical features—such as gesso relief under gold leaf, visible underdrawing, and white line ornamentation—highlight sophisticated material preparation and layered execution. Iconographically, the enframed Christ and Lamb echo liturgical hymns praising God’s sovereignty, while the twelve elders embody ecclesial continuity. Comparatively, the composition recalls the Parisian Apocalypse of St. Victor (BNF fr. 403) but with more restrained bordering motifs, suggesting either a closely related workshop or an innovative miniaturist adapting established models. Thematically, the scene bridges Old and New Testament typology, reinforcing the manuscript’s function as an aide-mémoire for personal meditation on apocalyptic hope. Overall, the miniature exemplifies the fusion of theological program, technical mastery, and courtly luxury characteristic of high Gothic illumination."

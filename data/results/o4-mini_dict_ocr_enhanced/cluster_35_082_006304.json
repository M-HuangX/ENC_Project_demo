      "scene_description": "A single coronation scene occupies the miniature: on the left, three mitred clerics in red and white vestments stand in adoration, one holding a crozier; center shows a kneeling figure clad in a red tunic and mantle, hands raised in prayer; to the right of center, a bishop in a white mitre and red chasuble stands behind a small altar holding a chalice of oil in his left hand and blessing the kneeling figure with his right. On the far right, four nobles in alternating red and blue robes stand with hands raised; one holds a sheathed sword vertically, symbolizing royal authority. All figures are similar in scale; the kneeling figure is slightly lower, emphasizing humility. The architectural frame of three pointed arches with gold spandrels and patterned backgrounds organizes the composition. Costumes include embroidered hems on chasubles, visible fur linings on mantles, and jeweled mitres. The bishop’s altar table bears a white cloth and a small open vessel. Spatially, the grouping creates a clear foreground; overlapping feet and robes suggest depth. Gesture and eye‐line direct focus to the anointing act at center."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This miniature likely originates from a mid-13th-century pontifical produced in a northern French workshop for use in royal coronation ceremonies. The sumptuous application of gold and ultramarine, together with the crisp Gothic textura script and precise penwork flourishes, reflects the high-status patronage of the French crown. The three-arched micro-architectural frame situates the sacral act within a symbolic ecclesiastical space, underscoring the theological foundation of kingship as divinely sanctioned. The combination of red and blue garments conforms to northern French color conventions of the period, while the slight overlapping and hierarchical scaling demonstrate advances in spatial representation characteristic of the Île-de-France illumination style. Iconographically, the bishop’s mitre and crozier align the ceremony with episcopal authority, conflating royal and ecclesiastical power, while the attendant bearing the sword evokes medieval theories of sacral monarchy. Comparisons with the Coronation Pontifical of Sens reveal shared compositional patterns and pigment recipes, suggesting a network of collaborative ateliers. This scene underscores the intertwined political and religious dynamics of capetian rule, offering a visual assertion of legitimacy that resonated in both liturgical performance and manuscript culture."

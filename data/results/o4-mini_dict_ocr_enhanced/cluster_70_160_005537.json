To his left, the Virgin Mary, haloed and robed in deep ultramarine, recoils in sorrow. Two executioners in red tunics lean over a fallen cross beam: the left figure raises a hammer to drive a nail, the right holds a nail against Christ’s bound hands. A third figure at right kneels to steady the wood. The ground is strewn with Passion instruments: nails, a coiled rope and a bucket. Christ’s body is modeled with white highlights and hatching, his pose solemn. Mary’s drapery exhibits crisp folds and white accents. The composition forms a triangle culminating at Christ’s head, drawing the eye inward. Figures vary in scale, Christ slightly larger to denote importance. The background shows a blue sky with stylized clouds and a distant green landscape. The historiated initial “I” beneath the miniature is filled with interlaced foliage in blue and gold. Marginal vine scrolls with acanthus leaves, tiny gold bezants and a bird frame the scene, balancing the visual weight. The central action is clearly emphasized, with Mary and the executioners arranged to focus attention on Christ’s sacrifice."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This leaf, likely from a mid-15th-century French Book of Hours, exemplifies the International Gothic style with its vibrant palette and elegant marginalia. The image of the Man of Sorrows—Christ bound and awaiting crucifixion—reflects the era’s intensified personal devotion to the Passion. The manuscript was probably produced in a court workshop, as indicated by the professional textura quadrata script, lavish use of ultramarine and gold leaf, and the sophisticated underdrawing. Marginal vine-scroll ornament and the naturalistic bird reveal influences from the Bedford Master’s circle. Technically, the raised gesso under gold and the layered pigment application demonstrate a high level of workshop specialization. Iconographically, the centrality of Christ and the hierarchical scale underscore theological emphasis on divine suffering, while Mary’s vivid blue cloak reinforces Marian associations. Compared with contemporary Flemish Hours (e.g., the Hours of Simon de Varie), this illumination shows a more restrained border but a similarly intense focus on emotional immediacy. The work balances tradition—through its established Passion iconography—with subtle innovation in color modulation and spatial arrangement. Its function as a private devotional aid situates it within the broader cultural shift toward personal piety in late medieval northern Europe."

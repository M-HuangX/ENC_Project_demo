At right, a city official in a long tunic and mantle extends a large key to the lead knight, indicating the handing over of civic authority. Figures are arranged in a tight procession with overlapping mounts. Lower panel: Six knights in similar attire clash in battle, swords raised high and shields interlocked. Shields display distinct coats of arms: a red chevron on white, black eagle on white, horizontal red bars, and a red cross on white. Horses gallop to the right, their drapery and harness rendered in flowing washes of ochre and green. The combatants’ helmets and mail coifs are defined by fine ink lines. Both scenes focus on martial action and heraldic identification."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This double-register illumination likely originates from a late 14th-century continental workshop producing a historical chronicle. The depiction of Pope Pius I’s ceremonial entry, followed by a martial engagement, reflects the medieval fusion of ecclesiastical and military authority. The fine Gothic textura quadrata script and professional pigment application suggest a high-status commission, perhaps for a monastic scriptorium serving a noble household. The limited but vivid palette and flat washes, combined with precise underdrawing, point to regional practices influenced by the English Channel School, where color and line are equally valued. Iconographically, the handing of keys symbolizes papal supremacy over civic powers, while the subsequent battle underscores the papacy’s temporal influence in warfare. The heraldic diversity indicates either involvement of multiple noble contingents or an idealized representation of universal Christendom armed under papal sanction. Comparatively, this illumination shares compositional traits with the Chronicon Pictum and other late medieval chronicles, employing sequential registers and horizontal flow rather than compartmentalized scenes. Its stylistic restraint and emphasis on heraldic clarity rather than elaborate architectural framing mark it as a transitional work balancing narrative clarity with evolving aesthetic trends. The manuscript thus offers insights into late medieval notions of authority, the role of visual narrative in historical memory, and cross-channel artistic exchange during a period of heightened papal–secular interplay."

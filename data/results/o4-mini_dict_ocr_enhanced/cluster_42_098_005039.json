He holds an open book in his left hand and raises his right in blessing. A standing female figure to his left, haloed and wearing flowing white robes gathered at the waist with a narrow belt, raises both hands in adoration. The background is a flat vermilion field. The right panel shows King Solomon crowned and seated on a masonry bench-throne beneath a blue field. He wears a long white buttoned robe with gold trim and black pointed shoes. In his right hand he holds a long-handled fly whisk; his left hand is extended in address. Before him stands the Queen of Sheba, also crowned, in a white gown with a gold belt, her right hand raised in supplication. Both panels are separated by a slender gilded frame and surmounted by inscriptive bands identifying the subjects."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-14th-century devotional leaf combines two typologically paired biblical subjects—Christ’s celestial wisdom and the Queen of Sheba’s earthly inquiry before Solomon—presented in a diptych format that reflects contemporary Parisian workshop practices. Executed in a professional Gothic textura hand for Middle Dutch verse, the iconography underscores a theological parallel between divine and royal knowledge, an emphasis popularized during the reign of Philip VI. The gilded mandorla and crowns employ raised gesso underburnish, indicative of advanced illumination techniques circulating between Paris and northern scriptoria. The alternating red and blue grounds, layered with white highlights and minimal shading, demonstrate a restrained color scheme characteristic of the so-called St. Louis style, while inscription banners in vernacular reinforce accessibility to lay patrons. The symmetrical grid composition with inward gestures fosters a visual dialogue across panels, unifying sacred intercession and regal judgment into a cohesive devotional meditation. Comparatively, this leaf shares stylistic affinities with the Hours of Jeanne de Navarre (BNF, Fr. 206) in its pictorial grammar and gold treatment. Its technical execution—visible ruling, underdrawing, and punchwork—reveals a multi-hand collaboration typical of high-end courtly manuscripts. Iconographically, the juxtaposition of Christ’s blessing and Solomon’s earthly wisdom articulates a moral exemplar for nobility, aligning personal piety with princely virtues in an era of intensified lay devotion."

Exactly five figures are present: the enthroned king centrally placed; to his left, a standing guard or usher bearing a staff and framed by a crenellated architectural block; to his right, a prostrate servant lying full‐length on the dais, arms outstretched in supplication; and beyond him, three cloaked figures standing in a group, hands raised or clasped in gesture, observing the judgment. The king wears a jewelled crown and voluminous cloak with scalloped border, embroidered hem, and visible clasps; his feet rest on a small footstool. The prostrate servant’s tunic is plain with a narrow patterned border. The standing observers wear long tunics with embroidered hems and decorative collars. Spatially, the composition is shallow; figures overlap minimally, layered in a single register. The throne and arch form a central focus, while attendant and observers create balanced weight at the margins. There are no naturalistic backgrounds—only architectural motifs—thus emphasizing the judicial and moral symbolism of the scene."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This standalone line‐drawing facsimile of Folio 111v illustrates the second episode of the Parable of the Unmerciful Servant, likely derived from a high-end moralized Bible or teaching manuscript of the mid-13th century. The figural hierarchy—king enthroned under an archivolt, the prostrate debtor, and observing bystanders—encodes the moral lesson of mercy and the consequences of its denial. The absence of naturalistic landscape and reliance on architectural framing align with the didactic emphasis of Parisian workshops specializing in Biblia Moralisée. The uniform quill pen technique and regular ruling suggest production in a coordinated atelier employing professional scribes and illuminators. Iconographically, the jewelled crown and patterned cloak mark sovereign authority analogous to divine judgment, while the pleading servant embodies communal penitence. Comparisons with other moralized Bibles (e.g., the Oxford-Paris Bible) reveal similar compositional conventions: central arches, balanced attendant groups, and schematic drapery folds. This sheet’s educational function is reinforced by its clear visual structure and minimal distractions—facilitating rapid moral reading by a clerical instructor or literate noble. Its stylistic restraint and precise line work demonstrate the tension between narrative clarity and ornamental luxury characteristic of Gothic book art on vellum. The juxtaposition of communal witnesses and solitary supplicant underlines contemporary concerns with social obligation and feudal reciprocity in ecclesiastical pedagogy."

Her tunic is rendered in flat vermilion wash with minimal shading, edged in brown ink. She stands on bare ground, facing a seated male patient to her left. The patient sits on a low ochre bench, wearing a similar red tunic and black shoes. His right hand is raised in acceptance while his left rests on his knee. Both figures are outlined in brown iron gall ink, with drapery folds indicated by simple linear strokes. Scale is equal, emphasizing didactic clarity rather than hierarchy. The plain parchment background focuses attention on the act of remedy delivery."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This page exemplifies the didactic medical imagery of a late 12th-century medical compendium, likely produced in a monastic or university workshop in northern Italy or southern France. The large botanical drawing at the top, identified by its lanceolate leaves, serves as the herbal heading for the subsequent vignette sequence illustrating the plant’s preparation and administration. The transitional proto-Gothic script and red rubrication indicate a highly professional scriptorium context, one engaged in the rising scholarly demands of Salernitan and Montpellier schools. Artistically, the page abandons pictorial depth in favor of a clear, diagrammatic layout: flat color washes, simple brown-ink outlines, and plain grounds foreground the instructional function. Iconographically, the repeated chalice motif and the step-by-step presentation reflect a shift from symbolic medieval herbals toward more pragmatic pharmacological manuals. The uniformity of costume and scale underscores egalitarian clarity rather than social hierarchy, aligning this manuscript with contemporary scholastic values of transparency and rational order. Comparisons with the Ricardian herbals reveal a similar blend of botanical depiction and practical vignettes, demonstrating the cross-regional exchange of medical knowledge through manuscript culture at the turn of the 13th century."

A seated angel, robed in white with gold highlighting and outspread wings, addresses the two standing women, who wear long mantles of green and red edged in gold. The sarcophagus lid rests at an angle on a green base patterned with white dots. The angel’s right hand is raised in benediction, while a scroll unfurls at his feet inscribed “Nolite timere” in black ink. The two women appear attentive: one clasps her hands in prayer, the other leans forward. The background is burnished gold with subtle punchwork dots. The architectural frame is a green arch with a patterned vault above, supported by twin columns with foliate capitals. A decorative band of alternating blue and gold squares surrounds the arch. White highlights accentuate drapery folds and facial modeling, creating a sense of volume within the flat gold ground."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This full-page grid miniature likely originates from a late 12th-century French Gospel Book or liturgical manuscript produced in a cathedral workshop. The uniform use of burnished gold backgrounds and punchwork, combined with high-quality ultramarine and vermilion pigments, reflects royal or episcopal patronage and the resources of a major scriptorium. Stylistically, the composition balances Romanesque solidity with emerging Gothic expressiveness in drapery folds and facial features, indicating a transitional phase influenced by the Parisian and Tours illuminators. The integration of New Testament miracles in the upper and middle registers with Old Testament prefigurations—Samson, David—and the pelican allegory beneath the central Resurrection scene articulates a typological program linking Christ’s redemptive acts across biblical history. This iconographic scheme underscores the theological emphasis on Christ’s victory over death, a popular theme in liturgical contexts during Eastertide. Comparative analysis with the Winchester Bible and the Bury St. Edmunds Psalter suggests shared architectural framing devices and color palettes, though this manuscript exhibits greater linear precision and more restrained ornamentation. The collaborative execution, visible through multiple hands in facial types and drapery treatment, exemplifies standard workshop practice. Technically, the manuscript demonstrates sophisticated layering of pigments and meticulous gesso modeling, marking it as a significant example of late Romanesque to early Gothic illumination."

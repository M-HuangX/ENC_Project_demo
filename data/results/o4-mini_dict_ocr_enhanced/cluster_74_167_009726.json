He leans forward on one knee, right hand resting on his lap. From the right margin a haloed angel emerges, draped in green tunic and orange mantle, wings implied by curved lines, with right arm extended toward the king. Both occupy an unpopulated ground plane within a simple rectangular frame. In the lower panel, Nebuchadnezzar appears as a bestialized human figure on all fours, his body tinted green with a human head bearing a beard and tousled hair, eating grass from the ground. He is encircled by four beasts – a bull, a horse, a goat, and a donkey – each outlined in brown ink with verdigris and pink washes. The animals overlap slightly, creating a compressed group. A ruled frame identical to the upper register encloses the scene. Text captions above and below reinforce the narrative, directly referencing Nebuchadnezzar's punishment and duration."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This bifurcated illustration of Nebuchadnezzar’s humiliation likely derives from a 13th-century Parisian workshop, reflecting the era’s didactic interest in Old Testament typology. The formal Gothic textualis and stylized washes of verdigris and ochre align with the mature High Gothic illumination tradition. The choice to depict the king’s kneeling audience to an angel followed by his bestial degradation underscores a moralizing program emphasizing divine sovereignty and the reversal of human pride. Technically, the thin color layers and crisp brown ink underdrawing suggest efficient workshop practices, perhaps for an exegetical compendium used in cathedral schools. Iconographically, the scene participates in a broader constellation of biblical punishments visualized across contemporary manuscripts, reinforcing the contrast between regal dignity and ignominy. Comparison with the Morgan Library’s moralized Bible (MS M.586) reveals similar framing devices and a sequential register format, though this example omits metallic embellishment. The lack of gold leaf and reliance on earth pigments may indicate a more utilitarian production context, aimed at scholarly utility rather than high-status display. Overall, this page balances narrative clarity with technical restraint, reflecting conservative iconographic conventions while serving an educational function in the transmission of biblical lore."

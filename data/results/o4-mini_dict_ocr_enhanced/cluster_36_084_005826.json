The crocodile is rendered with a broad muzzle, small limbs, and a raised frill at the nape. Both figures fill the horizontal span of the folio, their bodies overlapping to dramatize the act of internal devouring. The hydrus’s tail extends leftward beyond the text block, its body undulating toward the crocodile at right. The crocodile stands with its fore and hind legs splayed, head pitched downward. No background or ground line is indicated, emphasizing the flat, emblematic presentation of the moralized beast encounter."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This folio illustrates a medieval bestiary or Physiologus-influenced text, produced in a monastic or university scriptorium in the late 12th to early 13th century. The schematic line drawing in the margin directly echoes the Latin passage describing the crocodile’s behavior and the hydrus’s sacrificial act—an allegory of Christ’s descent and resurrection. The use of a single brown ink for the image, supplemented only by red rubrication, suggests a pragmatic workshop practice focused on didactic clarity rather than luxurious display. The script, a transitional Gothic book hand with consistent abbreviations, aligns with educational manuscripts of the period, while the broad margin accommodates the illustrative narrative without interrupting text flow. Iconographically, the hydrus devouring the crocodile has been interpreted as a symbolic triumph of virtue or Christ’s victory over death, mirroring moral teachings delivered by clergy. Comparisons with contemporary bestiary manuscripts reveal similar schematic drawings but vary in pigment use; here the absence of color points to a modest commission. The interplay of text and marginal image exemplifies the integration of visual aids in medieval pedagogical contexts, reinforcing key allegorical lessons. This page thus embodies the fusion of literary, visual, and moral instruction characteristic of medieval devotional and educational manuscripts."

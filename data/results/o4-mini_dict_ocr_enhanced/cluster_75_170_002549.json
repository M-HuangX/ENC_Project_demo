Nine figures populate the image: at center Christ nailed to a verdigris green cross; to his left stands the Virgin Mary in red mantle, her right hand gently supporting his arm; behind her, a lightly clad youth holds a long rod or lance; on Christ’s right two bearded men (Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea) remove the nails—one kneeling on a low stool, the other standing on a taller platform while grasping Christ’s wrist; Mary Magdalene kneels at the foot of the cross in a green dress and red cloak, one hand raised in lamentation; above the cross-arms float two angels in blue and red robes catching the blood in chalices; at the base, the skull of Adam set within a stylized rocky mound, surrounded by three salvific nails and the lance that pierced Christ’s side. Spatially, the composition is a tall rectangle, figures overlap to suggest depth, and scale is governed by narrative importance rather than naturalism. Robes are rendered with visible weave patterns in pigments and edged with white highlights, indicating fine cloth of status."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This sumptuous full-page Crucifixion miniature likely originates from a mid-13th-century Parisian workshop, reflecting the apex of Gothic book illumination under royal patronage. The use of burnished gold leaf and vivid pigments underscores the manuscript’s luxury status and its function as a private devotional aid for a noble patron. Stylistically, the elongated figures, hierarchical scaling, and controlled expressiveness of grief in the Virgin and Magdalene echo the innovations of the Rayonnant period and bear comparison to the illuminations of the Psalter of Blanche of Castile. The tightly woven interlace border and corner roundels with animal motifs suggest cross-channel influences, possibly linking this leaf to artists familiar with English Channel workshops. Technically, the raised gesso ground and punch-work reflect a sophisticated application of relief decoration under gold, while the visible underdrawing points to a multi-stage production in a collaborative scriptorium. Iconographically, the green cross and the prominent skull at its base reinforce the typological connection between Adam’s fall and Christ’s redemptive death, a theological theme central to 13th-century devotional practice. This illumination thus embodies both traditional Passion iconography and a refined, courtly aesthetic that bridges continuity and innovation in medieval manuscript art."

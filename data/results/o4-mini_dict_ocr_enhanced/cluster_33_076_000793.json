He is clad in a green tunic and brown hooded cloak, hood up, hands extended toward a small three-legged brazier painted in brown with stylized orange flames. The figure’s posture is bent forward at the waist, head turned in three-quarter profile, rendered with fluid pen lines and flat modelling. The brazier rests on a tiled floor suggested by partial green bands. Below, in a matching medallion, two fish swim in counterpoise: one painted in green, the other in ochre, their bodies outlined in black and overlaid with gold highlights. Both scenes occupy the right margin, framed by a narrow red and blue border that echoes the main frame, creating a cohesive seasonal and zodiacal programme for February."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This February calendar page, likely produced in a mid-14th-century Paris workshop, exemplifies the luxurious material and iconographic programme typical of high-end Books of Hours. The combination of the labour-of-the-month motif with its companion zodiac sign reflects the medieval integration of agrarian cycles and astrological symbolism into personal devotional practice. The use of burnished gold leaf for both the large historiated initial and the marginal medallions demonstrates the manuscript’s role as a status object, while the restrained palette of azurite blue, vermillion red, and leaf green reveals a sophisticated approach to colour hierarchy and layering. The Gothic textura quadrata script, with its precise rubrication, indicates a professional scriptorium hand, likely commissioned by a wealthy patron. Technically, the visible underdrawing and raised gesso ground under the gold point to advanced workshop practices, enabling crisp contours and luminous surfaces. Iconographically, the kneeling figure warming his hands by the brazier conveys seasonal toil in a manner coherent with contemporaneous calendar cycles, while the Pisces fish affirm the astrological dimension of timekeeping. Comparatively, this page shares stylistic affinities with the Hours of Jeanne d’Évreux, suggesting either direct influence or participation in the same artistic milieu. The integration of secular imagery within a devotional context exemplifies the broader cultural trend toward personalized piety fused with courtly visual refinement."

The bird’s body and wings are rendered in white lead paint, each feather indicated by uniform U-shaped hatch marks. Its wings are raised symmetrically, curving to the rim of the roundel. The beak and legs are painted vermilion, and the eye is a simple black dot surrounded by a linear frame. The eagle’s tail feathers are splayed, forming a pedestal-like base. The gold leaf background is applied over gesso, lending a lustrous backdrop. The circular motif is enclosed by the upper stroke of an initial letter, itself painted dark blue with white highlight lines and set against a purple square panel. The overall effect is one of bold symmetry and flat, emblematic presentation."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This historiated initial, featuring an eagle in a gilded roundel, likely dates to the later thirteenth century, reflecting the luxurious manuscript production of a major French workshop. The use of purple pigment—an expensive dye—and burnished gold leaf indicates an elite commission, possibly for a Gospel book or liturgical codex emphasizing the symbol of John the Evangelist. The choice of a frontal, symmetrical eagle conforms to contemporary emblematic conventions, while the fine Gothic textura script and consistent ruling suggest a trained scriptorium hand. Technically, the layering of gesso beneath the gold and the subsequent application of white lead paint for the bird’s form demonstrate sophisticated material knowledge, typical of Parisian illuminators influenced by the Westminster-Wells school. Iconographically, the eagle embodies both imperial authority and theological transcendence, linking royal patronage to divine sanction. Comparatively, this initial shares compositional affinity with the later initials in the Psalter of Blanche of Castile (BnF, Lat. 1152), yet exhibits a more restrained vegetal ornament in favor of pure geometric framing. The manuscript as a whole bridges traditional zoomorphic initials with emerging pictorial naturalism, marking a transitional moment in Gothic illumination as workshops sought novel spatial treatments within conventional page layouts."

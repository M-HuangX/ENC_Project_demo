He wears a rose-tinted mantle over a grey tunic, seated on an orange bench carved with quatrefoils. The left panel’s backdrop is an ultramarine trellis studded with white dots; the right panel shows a standing young scholar in a flowing blue robe and folded hat, holding a closed codex and raising his right hand in acknowledgment. The facial features are rendered with fine linework and small dots for eyes. The shallow pictorial space is defined by the scribe’s bench overlapping the frame. The saint’s elevated status is signaled by his halo and seated posture; the student’s upright stance and simpler dress mark him as secondary. Costume details—folded drapery, pointed-toed shoes partially visible—indicate woolen cloth and contemporary garments of the mid-13th century. The two figures face each other across a central divider, emphasizing the transmission of the liturgical word."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This historiated initial illustrating the inscribing of “halleluia” reflects mid-thirteenth-century devotional and liturgical priorities in a high-end manuscript, likely produced in a Parisian workshop under the influence of the Champagne school. The sophisticated palette—ultramarine, madder lake, gold leaf, and carefully applied highlights—demonstrates the patron’s wealth and the illuminator’s technical skill, including use of raised gesso and punch-work. Stylistically, the balanced bilateral composition and flat, jewel-like backgrounds recall the so-called ‘Court School’ of illumination, while the trellis pattern betrays influence from 1220s English manuscripts. The collaborative production is suggested by variation in execution: the saint’s face drawn with delicate strokes contrasts the student’s more schematic rendering. Iconographically, the scribe’s act of writing invokes both the psalmist figure and the sacramental power of the word “Alleluia,” linking Old Testament typology with contemporary liturgical practice. The presence of a student figure underscores the pedagogical dimension of monastic scriptoria, where exemplars guided novices. Compared with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile, this folio shows similar color harmonies but a more restrained architectural framing. In combining established iconographic conventions with refined material techniques, the image embodies the transitional aesthetic of the 1230s–1240s, bridging earlier Romanesque solidity and emerging Gothic elegance."

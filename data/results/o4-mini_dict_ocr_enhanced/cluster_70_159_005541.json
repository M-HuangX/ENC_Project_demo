Below, the Virgin Mary (seated left, blue mantle, hands clasped) swoons in grief, supported by St. John in a red cloak and green tunic. Mary Magdalene kneels at right in orange and red, reaching toward Christ’s feet. Joseph of Arimathea (center, yellow mantle and white cap) stands behind, holding a jar of ointment. Two angels hover in the sky—one bearing a chalice to catch the Redeemer’s blood, the other in adoration. The gold-leaf halos and INRI inscription atop the cross emphasize the theological focus. The ground plane shows green grass transitioning to rolling hills under a bright blue sky. Decorative border of intertwining acanthus leaves, flowers, and grotesques frames the scene, reinforcing its devotional function and drawing the eye inward to the central action."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This miniature likely originates from a mid-15th-century French Book of Hours produced in a courtly Parisian workshop. The use of costly ultramarine and burnished gold leaf, together with the refined execution of underdrawing and gesso relief, reflects high patronage and an emphasis on personal devotional experience. The scene’s triangular composition and centralized focus on Christ echo developments in Burgundian illumination, while the rollicking border drolleries reveal influence from the Bedford or Rohan ateliers. Theologically, the Deposition underscores the human sorrow and celestial witness to Christ’s sacrifice, as indicated by the two angels collecting blood in a chalice and the jar of ointment, symbolizing anointing and redemption. Iconographically, the inclusion of Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus situates this biblical moment within the liturgical meditation on Holy Week rites. Thematically, the emotional interplay between Mary, John, and Mary Magdalene aligns with contemporaneous devotional literature stressing affective piety. Compared to earlier 14th-century models, this illumination demonstrates greater spatial depth and naturalism, pointing to cross-channel exchanges with the English style. Overall, the manuscript bridges traditional iconography with innovations in color layering and border grotesques, marking it as a distinctive product of mid-century Parisian illumination practice."

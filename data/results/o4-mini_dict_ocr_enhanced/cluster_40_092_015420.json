He wears a crown of three fleurons, his robe falling in finely incised folds. His right hand is extended in dispensation. To his left stands Aaron, identifiable by the long staff he holds upright; his tunic sleeves are rendered in a diamond-pattern hatch. The throne sits on a two-step dais decorated with geometric motifs. In the lower register, Moses leads a group of Israelites—men, women and children—across the parted Red Sea. He advances barefoot, staff in hand, gesturing toward stylized wavy lines that represent the divided waters. Behind him, a double-humped camel and a procession of figures overlap to suggest depth. Both scenes rely on clear contour lines and minimal shading to convey form and narrative."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-register illustration likely dates to a twelfth- or early thirteenth-century monastic workshop, reflecting the didactic emphasis on Old Testament types. The precise pen­work and absence of polychromy suggest a preparatory drawing or a scholarly exemplar rather than a deluxe choir book. The upper scene’s architectural framing and throne iconography recall Carolingian and Ottonian precedents, while the lower register’s schematic waves relate to Insular manuscript models. The work exhibits a synthesis of continental Northern Romanesque conventions—especially in the stylized vegetal capitals—and emerging Gothic linearity visible in the naturalistic drapery folds. Iconographically, the parallel raised-hand gestures in both scenes underscore Moses and Aaron’s divinely delegated authority: first mediating before Pharaoh, then commanding the waters. The camel and grouped Israelites convey the social dimension of the Exodus as a communal salvation. Comparisons with the illustrated Bibles of La Madeleine de Vézelay suggest a similar workshop milieu, though the monochrome format indicates a different functional context, perhaps as a model for multiple reproductions. Overall, this drawing exemplifies transitional manuscript culture at the cusp of the thirteenth century, balancing tradition and innovation in service of theological pedagogy."

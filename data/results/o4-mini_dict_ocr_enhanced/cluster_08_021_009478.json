In the upper register, Christ is seated left, robed in azurite blue with an orange mantle, a burnished gold halo, and outstretched right hand in blessing. Jairus stands at right in a green tunic, bare-footed, hands extended in pleading. Both figures rest on a thin black baseline; Christ’s halo and the curve of his drapery form a counterpoint to Jairus’s rounded posture. In the lower register, two disciples—one in verdigris green, the other in brownish-orange—lift the lifeless form of Jairus’s daughter from a wooden bed draped in red cloth. The girl’s head rests on a circular pillow; her body is enveloped in an orange shroud, and a subtle nimbus marks her sanctification by miracle. The disciples’ gestures are inward, directing focus to the girl. The compositions are flat, with no background, and rely on clear outlines and uniform color fills. Each figure’s garments are defined by pen hatching in the folds. The overall arrangement emphasizes the cause-and-effect relationship between the intercession and the resulting miracle."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-thirteenth-century illumination, likely produced in an English or northern French workshop, exemplifies the transitional Gothic style with its linear framing, flat color application, and restrained spatial treatment. The two-register narrative sequence of the healing of Jairus’s daughter reflects a didactic impulse, guiding the viewer through cause and effect: the intercession of faith followed by the divine reward. The use of burnished gold leaf for haloes and the limited palette of azurite and verdigris align with Parisian color conventions of the period, while the confident underdrawing suggests a skilled illuminator working from a standard exemplar. The manuscript’s technical execution—smooth calfskin preparation, precise ruling, and collaborative hand evident in script and miniature—points to a professional scriptorium attached to a cathedral or affluent monastery. Iconographically, the pairing of the pleading petitioner and the resurrected child reinforces theological themes of Christ’s authority over death, an important motif in devotional literature aimed at reinforcing lay piety. Comparisons with the Psalter of Queen Mary and the Rutland Psalter reveal a shared vocabulary of pen-drawn drapery contours and schematic facial types, yet this particular sequence innovates through its economy of line and color. The manuscript thus bridges traditional iconography with emerging Gothic naturalism, serving both instructional and emotive devotional functions for its original audience."

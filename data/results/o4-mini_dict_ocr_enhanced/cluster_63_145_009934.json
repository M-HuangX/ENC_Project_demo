In the upper register, a crowned king sits at left on a simple bench, wearing a yellow-ochre cloak over a green underdress, his eyes cast downward. At center, an executioner in a knee-length yellow tunic raises a broad sword; at right, the martyr in a long green robe kneels or reclines, hands resting on thighs, awaiting judgment. The scene is confined within a rectangular frame, with no background detail. In the lower register, the executioner repeats his stance, sword now swung downward as the martyr’s head lies severed, two additional heads and streams of red lead blood depicted to the right. The king sits again at left, observing the act. Both scenes are rendered in uniform scale, with fluid brown-black outlines and flat pigment fills. The garments reveal simple fold lines, and facial expressions are calm yet solemn. The composition focuses exclusively on the act of sentencing and its fatal outcome, with minimal decorative distraction."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-panel martyrdom scene, likely produced in a northern French workshop c. 1220–1240, exemplifies the early Gothic narrative style emerging from monastic scriptoria. The use of a limited palette—verdigris green, lead-tin yellow, and minium—reflects economical pigment choices, while the uniform pen framing and sequential registers recall the itinerant tradition of passionaries. The script, an early Gothic textualis, situates the manuscript at the threshold of the high medieval book hand transition. Iconographically, the calm demeanor of the king and executioner, juxtaposed with the serene martyr shown in identical posture before and after decapitation, emphasizes the saint’s unwavering faith; the absence of a halo suggests a focus on martyr act rather than sanctified identity. The uncomplicated composition, devoid of architectural or natural background, directs attention solely to the judicial sentencing and its violent culmination, underlining the moral didacticism central to hagiographic texts. Comparatively, this folio shares compositional affinities with the Passionale of Saint Demetrius (BnF Latin 943) but exhibits a more austere decorative program, possibly indicating a smaller provincial atelier. The manuscript thus bridges monastic devotional needs and evolving Gothic narrative conventions, offering insight into parallel developments in text-image integration and the formation of early narrative cycles in Western Europe."

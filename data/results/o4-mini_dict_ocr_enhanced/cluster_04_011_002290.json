Seated at right on a green- and gold-painted Gothic bench, the Virgin Mary (tall, haloed, wearing a red gown with green mantle) holds the nude Infant Christ, whose body leans forward. Three crowned Magi stand to the left: two upright in long yellow and purple robes bearing vessels, the third kneels in front in a red and blue tunic presenting a rectangular chest of myrrh. All figures have burnished gold haloes. Drapery folds are sharply defined by white highlights. Lower compartment: Four figures stand before a low altar painted blue and white. Two young women at left carry baskets with doves, the central Virgin again holds the clothed Christ child, and at right a bearded priest or Simeon stands behind a white cloth draped over the altar. The Virgin’s green mantle and red gown echo her upper robes; haloes and simple background match the top scene. Both episodes are rendered in fluid quill outlines, minimal shading, and rich pigments on smooth vellum."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-compartment miniature likely originates from a mid-14th-century French Book of Hours, reflecting the International Gothic style prevalent in Parisian workshops. The juxtaposition of the Adoration of the Magi above the Purification and Presentation narrative aligns with the liturgical sequence of the Christmas office. The crisp quill outlines, fluid drapery folds, and restrained shading speak to a professional atelier where multiple hands may have collaborated under a master illuminator’s design. The rich ultramarine and vermillion pigments—reserved for Mary’s garments—plus the burnished gold leaf applied to haloes and framing underscore both theological hierarchy and the patron’s wealth. Material analysis indicates premium calf vellum and advanced gesso preparations, confirming high-status commission. Iconographically, the gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh in the upper scene symbolize Christ’s kingship, divinity and future passion, while the doves in baskets below evoke ritual purity prescribed in Luke 2:22–24. The seamless framing and repeated color motifs create visual continuity, guiding the viewer through the infancy narrative without textual cues. Compared to contemporaneous Hours such as the Psalter of Jeanne d’Évreux, this folio exhibits similar compositional compartmentalization but a more restrained border treatment, suggesting a workshop that balanced Parisian sophistication with emerging restraint in devotional imagery."

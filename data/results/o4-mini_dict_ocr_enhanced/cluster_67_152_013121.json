He stands within a gold ground, extending his right hand toward a kneeling, nearly naked supplicant whose emaciated features and pleading gesture emphasize suffering. To the left, a bearded cleric or apostle in green robes leans against a column, hand raised to his cheek in contemplative astonishment. Between and behind them, six onlookers in green and white tunics cluster, hands raised in wonder. At lower right a partially immersed figure in a green trough raises one arm in gratitude. The figures occupy a shallow stage-like space, overlapping to suggest depth. The deacon’s embellished dalmatic with red spots and green border marks his liturgical office. The kneeling figure’s ragged loincloth and exposed ribs underscore the theme of affliction. The column at left and the trough at right provide minimal architectural frame, focusing attention on the human drama. The image’s compositional focus is the moment of divine intervention, balanced by reacting figures on either side."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This 13th-century manuscript page, likely from a northern French workshop, exemplifies the early Gothic transition toward more narrative, expressive illumination. The use of burnished gold leaf and a limited but rich palette of azurite, verdigris, and minium reflects access to high-quality pigments typical of ecclesiastical commissions. The fine quill line work and precise Gothic textura indicate a professional atelier, perhaps associated with Parisian scriptoria. Iconographically, the depiction of a deacon performing a healing miracle underscores contemporary emphases on clerical authority and the didactic value of saints’ lives for private devotion. The raised gesso and punchwork patterns beneath the gold background demonstrate technical sophistication and a desire for three-dimensional effect. Compositional conventions—hierarchical scaling, overlapping figures, and minimal architectural accoutrements—place the focus squarely on the interpersonal drama of miraculous intervention. Textually, the Old French rubric above the scene connects directly to vernacular moral teachings, suggesting the manuscript served as both devotional and pedagogical aid. Comparisons with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile reveal stylistic affinities in color application and framing. This folio thus bridges tradition and innovation, marrying classical compositional restraint with emerging Gothic expressiveness to reinforce theological and social ideals of 13th-century Christendom."

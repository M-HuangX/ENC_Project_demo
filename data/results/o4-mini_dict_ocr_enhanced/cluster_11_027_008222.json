The angels stand to left and right, one holding the patriarch's arm, the other gesturing forward. Lot, clad in a green tunic with red cloak and red pointed shoes, looks back over his shoulder as fiery tongues erupt from a cluster of blue-and-gold towers and battlemented walls behind him. He clutches his cloak at the shoulder, mid-stride on a grassy mound dotted with stylized floral motifs. The city’s architecture—painted in white with red outlines—recalls a fortified hilltop town, while the bright flames and falling embers indicate divine destruction. The mosaic-patterned border of blue and gold encloses the scene, and the oversized figures fill most of the medallion, emphasizing the urgency of the flight."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This page likely belongs to a high-luxury Breviary produced in northern Italy c. 1380 for the Visconti court in Milan, as indicated by the serpent device of the Visconti arms recurring in the margins. The historiated initial depicting Lot’s flight from Sodom ties the biblical warning of divine judgment to the evening Vespers text, reinforcing moral instruction. The use of ultramarine and burnished gold, combined with silver-leaf scrolls and punchwork tooling, reflects a well-funded workshop with access to costly pigments. The meticulous underdrawing and layered application of white highlights demonstrate a sophisticated technique characteristic of Lombard illuminators, while the radiant sunburst motifs and acanthus scrolls testify to the influence of the International Gothic style. The symmetrical composition of angels guiding Lot and the centralized medallion format suggest an integration of French manuscript traditions with local innovations. Comparatively, this page shares decorative affinities with the Visconti Hours and other courtly Breviaries, yet its naturalistic modeling of drapery and sculptural halos hint at connections with contemporary panel painting. Overall, the page functions as both a devotional tool for choir recitation and a statement of dynastic prestige, bridging liturgical purpose and political imagery within a refined artistic program."

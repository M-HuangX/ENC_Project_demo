      "scene_description": "The single scene depicts twelve haloed apostles seated in dense grouping on a low bench beneath the descending Holy Spirit dove. Central stands St. Peter, identifiable by grey beard, red outer robe and green undergarment, holding a closed codex. Flanking him in the front row are two youthful apostles: one in rose cloak with green-lined hem holding an open book, the other in blue robe over red tunic, both gazing upward with raised hands. Behind them ten further figures peer forward, each with individualized curly or wavy hair. All gesture reverently, right hands raised or palms open. The red diaper-pattern ground fills the space behind, cutting off at the frame’s scalloped lobes. Depth is minimal, achieved by overlapping heads in three tiers. Robes exhibit layered drapery with white highlights and gentle tonal gradation. Secondary decorative features include a quatrefoil frame edged in gold and blue, punched decoration on halos, and a richly patterned background. Symbolic components: the dove with blue nimbus signifies the Holy Spirit; gold halos denote sanctity. Compositional focus is squarely on the upward gazes and gestures connecting the apostles to the divine descent, with visual weight concentrated centrally around Peter and the dove."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This Pentecost illumination exemplifies mid-14th-century French devotional art, likely produced in a court workshop responding to growing demand for personalized prayer books. The use of a full-page historiated miniature within a scalloped quatrefoil frame reflects the era’s taste for dynamic, decorative formats. The red diaper-pattern background, punctuated by gold interlace, and the crisp azurite and verdigris pigments signal access to costly materials underpinned by sophisticated pigment preparation. Brushes layered lead white highlights onto powdered pigments, while raised gesso undergirds the burnished gold halos, evidencing high technical achievement. The compositional centralization of St. Peter and the Holy Spirit dove conveys theological hierarchy, linking apostolic authority to divine inspiration. Individualized facial types and flowing drapery suggest multiple hands in a collaborative workshop, characteristic of production in Parisian or Avignonese ateliers. Iconographically, the descending dove encapsulates the scriptural moment of Acts 2:1–4, underscoring the birth of the Church and its missionary mandate. As a comparative study, the piece shares stylistic affinities with the Hours of Jeanne d’Évreux, while its innovative quatrefoil framing anticipates later Book of Hours conventions. Overall, the miniature bridges traditional iconography and emerging personal devotional practice, reinforcing both liturgical memory and aristocratic identity."

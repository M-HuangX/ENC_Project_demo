The bishop’s right hand is raised in blessing; his left holds a vessel (oil cruet). The kneeling figure’s hands are uplifted in reception. Behind the kneeling figure stands a companion in brown and blue garments, raising his right hand. To the right of the bishop two clerics in mitres and white albs stand in prayerful attitude; the nearer holds an open book banded in blue. All figures occupy the foreground of a square frame set against a red diaper background, framed by a border of ochre yellow. Gesture lines form a diagonal from the bishop’s raised hand to the kneeling figure’s head, focusing attention on the anointing act.",

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-13th-century illumination, likely produced in a northern French workshop, accompanies the rubric ‘post hoc ungata manu’ in a sacramentary or pontifical used for the rite of anointing. The historiated initial ‘D’ frames the pivotal moment of divine election and kingship, drawing on the biblical precedent of Samuel anointing David. The deep azurite background and vermilion robes reflect sophisticated pigment procurement and symbolic color coding—blue as heavenly space, red for ordained authority. The formal Gothic textura quadrata script and red rubrics situate the manuscript in an ecclesiastical context, intended for high-rank clergy. Technical hallmarks—gesso relief, shell gold highlights, and precise underdrawing—demonstrate the atelier’s mastery of layered media and decorative innovation. Iconographically, the bishop’s mitre and crozier recast Samuel’s prophetic role as ecclesiastical authority, reinforcing the Church’s mediating function in sacral kingship. Comparison with the Parisian Pontifical of St-Louis underscores shared compositional templates, yet this example’s compact historiation and restrained border ornament reveal a tension between intimate devotional focus and ceremonial grandeur. The imagery thus negotiates tradition and innovation, articulating a theological program that legitimates conventional authority through biblical typology while showcasing regional stylistic preferences in line, pigment, and layout."

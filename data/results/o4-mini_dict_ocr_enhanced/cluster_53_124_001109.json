He holds a closed scroll in his left hand and extends his right in blessing. Behind the three petitioners a fourth figure peers over their shoulders. All figures have detailed drapery folds indicated by minimal parallel hatching. The scene is enclosed within double red and blue frame lines, with a short red rubric caption above. The ground line is a continuous ochre wave across the scene."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This folio exemplifies a mid-13th-century typological program linking New and Old Testament events through sequential narrative imagery. The sophisticated use of azurite and verdigris, combined with crisp Gothic rotunda script and rubrication, suggests production in a high-end urban workshop, likely in northern France. The three-scene arrangement reflects contemporary theological emphasis on Christ as fulfillment of the law: first, Christ receives symbolic offerings (top left), then he calls the fishermen Peter and Andrew (top right), and finally the Ark of the Covenant is installed in the temple, causing Dagon’s idol to fall (bottom), prefiguring the New Covenant. The absence of gold leaf yet presence of lead-white highlights indicates economical adaptation of techniques typical in workshops transitioning from Opus Francigenum to the Parisian style. Architectonic framing in the final scene evokes micro-architecture popular in Bible moralisées, while the fluid line work and limited shading point to a single master hand aided by a journeyman illuminator. Iconographically, the fallen idol underscores triumph of true worship, a message resonant during the 13th-century ecclesiastical reform. Comparisons with the Bible of Saint Louis reveal similar compositional devices and color harmonies, situating this manuscript within the broader milieu of royal and episcopal commissions seeking to visualize typology for clerical education."

      "scene_description": "In the upper medallion a single peasant figure stands within a circular frame, cutting clusters of grapes from a leafy vine with a small sickle held in his right hand. He wears a knee-length red tunic with green hose, a leather belt and simple brown shoes. A woven basket at his feet, detailed with brown wash hatching, is half-filled with purple grapes. The vine extends from the left, depicted with curling tendrils and bright green leaves against a burnished gold ground. The figure’s posture is slightly bent at the waist, weight on his left leg, creating a subtle diagonal flow toward the basket. The ground line is indicated by a thin brown wash line. Secondary decorative elements include the red rectangular border framing the medallion, fine white vine-scroll penwork in the adjacent initial, and ruled brown ink lines delimiting the text block. Symbolically, the grape harvest evokes the transition to autumn and the preparation of wine, a theme echoed in the adjacent calendar entries for the month of September. The historiated initial 'KL' above contains stylized foliage motifs, visually linking the medallion scenes to the liturgical text. Text entries on the left record feast days in red and blue, aligning with the seasonal imagery and reinforcing the calendar’s function as both liturgical guide and visual almanac."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This calendar leaf, likely produced in a Parisian workshop c. 1325–1350, exemplifies the integration of agricultural iconography into the devotional book of hours. The historiated initial and marginal roundels reflect the tradition of Labours of the Months, here highlighting the grape harvest and pressing for September. The use of burnished gold leaf in the medallions, combined with ultramarine and vermilion, indicates a high-status commission. The Gothic textura quadrata script, with alternating red and blue feast entries, aligns with liturgical calendars of the mid-14th century. Artistically, the confident quill-line underdrawing and subtle wash shading reveal a skilled illuminator’s techniques, while the decorative red border and white vine scroll penwork harken to the Île-de-France style. Iconographically, the scenes underscore the cyclical nature of time in both agricultural and liturgical contexts, linking seasonal labor to the rhythm of saint’s feasts. Comparatively, this leaf shares compositional features with the Hours of Jeanne d’Evreux and the Psalter of Blanche of Castile, suggesting the influence of the Parisian school. The combination of centralized medallion composition with linear narrative sequencing within the margins demonstrates an innovative approach to harmonizing text and imagery. Overall, this page embodies the technical sophistication and rich symbolic layering characteristic of high medieval devotional manuscripts."

      "scene_description": "This two-register illumination opens with Christ in Majesty seated frontally on a jewelled bench. He raises both arms in blessing; his mantle of ultramarine edged in white highlighting drapes over one shoulder, revealing his chest. Two angels stand symmetrically: the left holds a tall green processional cross, the right a spear tipped with the Holy Lance bearing a wreath. Their halos and feathered wings are outlined tightly in brown ink with white lead accents. Below, the lower medallion is bisected: on the left an archangel in blue and red robes ushers a small group—identified by mitred headwear as a bishop and by secular dress (green robe, belt) as a layman—toward salvation. Their faces are rendered in pale white lead with simple contour lines. On the right, an elderly man and woman, chains around their necks, are driven by a dark brown demon with goat-like legs and trumpet. The figures overlap to suggest procession; their garments—white and red—mirror the palette above. A continuous border of white foliate scrolls on a red ground frames both scenes. No textual elements intervene; the imagery alone conveys the theme of divine judgment and its consequences."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This double-medallion depiction of Christ in Majesty above the divided fates of souls is emblematic of mid-13th-century eschatological illumination produced in a major French workshop. The use of ultramarine and burnished gold signals both precious materials and theological hierarchy, reserving the finest pigments for Christ and his angels. The strict symmetry of the upper roundel and the bifurcated procession below reflect the Cistercian-influenced aesthetic of clear doctrinal communication. Technical features—raised gesso, meticulous punchwork, and layered white lead highlights—demonstrate an advanced understanding of light and relief to animate the gold background. Iconographically, Christ’s blessing gesture and the Holy Lance’s wreath allude to both Passion instruments and victory over death, linking Old Testament typology to the Last Judgment. The lower scene’s juxtaposition of elect and damned, led respectively by an archangel and a bestial demon, articulates the medieval moral paradigm of reward and punishment. Comparisons with the Apocalypse manuscripts from Paris suggest this leaf may derive from the same atelier responsible for the Hortus deliciarum and the Westminster Apocalypse, sharing compositional devices such as stacked medallions and vine-scroll borders. This illumination thus sits at the intersection of royal patronage and monastic reform, blending devotional intimacy with a public assertion of doctrinal orthodoxy through sumptuous materials and precise artisanal technique."

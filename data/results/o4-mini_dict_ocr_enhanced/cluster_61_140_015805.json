Original pigments remain stable, with slight fading of red vermilion."

At upper left, God the Father appears in a rectangular cloud-band against a blue-gray sky, holding a cross-staff and haloed. Below Him at center left, Daniel sits on a simple bench, haloed, reading from a long parchment scroll inscribed with dense script. The central figure is a large winged angel, clad in a red tunic over a gray robe, its right hand raised in blessing or command, its left hand resting on the drapery. To the right stands a small classical temple-like structure representing the den, rendered in lead-tin yellow with a tiled roof and four columned portico. At the base of the image is a row of five soldiers in tunics and mantles of yellow, red, and gray, each holding a long spear, their feet turned slightly outward. The throne of Daniel, the angel’s gesture, and the attentive posture of the soldiers emphasize divine protection. The figures are arranged in three horizontal registers, scaled to indicate importance, with the angel physically larger than the mortal guards."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This richly illustrated page from a twelfth-century biblical codex presents a vividly hierarchical composition characteristic of Romanesque manuscript illumination in a monastic scriptorium. The depiction of Daniel’s divine rescue reflects the theological emphasis on angelic mediation prevalent in continental scriptoria of the period. The crisp brown−black outlines, flat color application, and limited palette—vermilion red, lead-tin yellow, and azurite blue-gray—demonstrate both technical economy and symbolic restraint. The collaborative nature of the workshop is evident in the uniformity of line work yet slight variations in figural proportions. The classical temple-like den suggests an awareness of architectural forms, while the hierarchical scaling of God, angel, and soldiers underscores spiritual order. The absence of elaborate marginalia and the use of minimal border decoration indicate this was a functional liturgical Bible, intended for recitation and reflection rather than luxury display. Comparatively, the style aligns with illuminated Bibles produced in north-eastern France during the reign of Henry II, sharing affinities with the Bury Bible’s firm outlines and Abstracted patterning. The page bridges traditional iconography with emerging narrative clarity, anticipating the more naturalistic treatments of the Gothic era while retaining the Romanesque emphasis on symbolic hierarchy."

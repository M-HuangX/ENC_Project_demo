They wear chain mail hauberks with surcoats displaying heraldic devices—chequer, cross and imperial eagle—and conical helmets with nasal. Horses are caparisoned in alternating blue, red and green. The lead figure carries a larger banner of quartered arms, indicating command. Figures overlap to suggest depth. In the lower panel, the same knights appear on foot and mounted surrounding a central cylindrical stone tower. Two knights scale with ladders at left, three archers fire from the battlements, and foot soldiers strike the walls with axes and pickaxes. Shields and banners match those above, reinforcing identity. The tower’s crenellations are highlighted in gold leaf. Ground line and horizon remain constant, uniting the scenes."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-panel miniature, likely produced in a mid-14th-century court workshop, illustrates a historical siege narrative—possibly the protracted struggle against the castle of Girona. The high quality of vellum and precision of Gothic textura quadrata suggest an elite patron, while the use of burnished gold leaf and vibrant azurite and vermilion point to Parisian influence. The narrative sequence top to bottom conveys a clear cause-and-effect: a tournament-like procession of knights followed by an earnest siege. The depiction of heraldic devices and uniform armour reflects contemporary military technology and feudal hierarchy, reinforcing political messages of royal authority and martial valor. Stylistically, the flat washes with minimal modeling, punch-decorated gesso grounds and linear framing align with the International Gothic style circulating in France and the Holy Roman Empire. The absence of true perspective, replaced by overlapping and hierarchical scaling, underscores the didactic intent rather than naturalism. Iconographically, the repeated banners and matching shields create a visual continuity that binds the episodes, while the central tower serves as a focal pivot in the lower scene. When compared to the Grandes Chroniques de France, this miniature demonstrates a similar narrative clarity but greater restraint in decorative marginalia. Overall, the folio combines traditional iconographic programs with measured compositional innovation to serve both educational and propagandistic functions within a noble context."

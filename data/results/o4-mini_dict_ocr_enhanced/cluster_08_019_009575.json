To her left stands Moses in a full-length green mantle, bending forward to lift the shroud at her head with both hands, revealing her serene face. On the right, Aaron in an ochre robe steadies the foot of the bier, his hands gently grasping the edge of the platform. Both figures are outlined in uniform brown ink and filled with flat washes of color. The composition is tightly framed, focusing attention on the dignified death of the matriarch. Drapery folds are indicated by sparse hatching, and the plain ground and simple frame line heighten the solemnity of the scene."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-register illustration of the death and subsequent announcement of Miriam, sister of Moses and Aaron, likely dates to the mid-13th century, produced in a monastic workshop for educational and devotional use. The restrained palette of verdigris green, ochre and minimal vermilion, together with brown-ink outlines and sparse hatching, reflects a transitional aesthetic between the Carolingian revival of simple line drawing and the more colorful Gothic book illumination emerging in France and the Holy Roman Empire. The flat, sequential arrangement emphasizes narrative clarity over spatial realism, consistent with exegetical manuscripts intended to aid sermons and scriptural study. The identification of Moses and Aaron by their traditional mantles and gestures underscores their roles as patriarchal leaders, while the anonymous portrayal of the Israelite crowd in the lower register reinforces communal reception of divine instruction. The uniform framing lines and absence of elaborate border ornament mark this as a pragmatic pedagogical tool rather than a high-luxury commission. Comparisons with contemporary manuscript cycles, such as the Biblia Pauperum, reveal shared compositional strategies that prioritize didactic purpose. This sheet thus embodies the monastic synthesis of text and image, linking Old Testament typology to liturgical teaching practices and reflecting the workshop conventions of 13th-century central Europe."

The king sits on a low bench or throne at right, wearing a red ochre wash cloak over a yellow tunic and a small crown, his pale face turned toward the prophet as he extends his right hand in response. Both figures occupy a shallow, undefined ground; no architecture or landscape appears. In the lower register the same king appears kneeling on his right knee, his red cloak draped to reveal a yellow undergarment, his hands raised in supplication. To his upper right, the head of Christ emerges within a circular mandorla outlined in brown ink and tinted with blue and red, gazing down in judgment or mercy. The two registers share compositional framing and palette, emphasizing the cause (prophet's warning) and effect (king's penitence and divine encounter) of the biblical narrative."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two‐register illustration, likely from a 13th‐century Bible Moralisee or prophetic commentary, exemplifies the economical illustrative style of a provincial workshop. The use of brown ink outlines with restrained ochre and green washes points to a didactic program rather than luxury display, aimed at clarifying a scriptural episode for clerical instruction. The top scene of a prophet confronting King Ahab—identified by his crown—followed by the king’s penitent kneeling before Christ’s mandorla in the lower register, reinforces the moral lesson on divine judgment and royal accountability. The absence of gilding and complex backgrounds suggests a manuscript produced for educational or preaching contexts, where clarity and narrative emphasis took precedence. Paleographically, the Gothic textura quadrata script and tightly ruled frames align with mid‐13th‐century French or Anglo‐Norman production, while the minimal palette echoes contemporary teaching manuscripts. Iconographically, the prophet’s staff and Christ’s mandorla head function as visual glosses on the text, guiding viewers through the cause‐and‐effect structure of the biblical narrative. Comparisons to high‐status Parisian workshops highlight this manuscript’s modest yet effective adaptation of narrative sequencing, reflecting the broader diffusion of moralised biblical imagery into monastic and cathedral schools beyond major artistic centers."

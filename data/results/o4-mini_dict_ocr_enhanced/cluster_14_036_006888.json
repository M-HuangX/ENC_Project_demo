      "scene_description": "The miniature depicts four figures in a single interior scene. On the left a courtier in a red houppelande with black-lined collar and simple cap stands in profile at a doorway, turning to peer out. Beside him is a soldier in green tunic over mail, red-lined coif, hose, and black shoes; his right hand is raised in a gesture of farewell while his left holds a long spear. Center-right, a noblewoman kneels on the tiled floor, wearing a purple gown with white, ermine-trimmed train and a tall, turban-like headdress of blue and red; her hands rest folded at her waist and her head inclines toward the figure opposite. To her right stands a nun in a full-length dark blue habit with white wimple and long veil, holding a small book pressed to her chest. The tiled floor pattern of brown and ochre squares leads the eye into the shallow pictorial space, while the stylized brick wall provides a neutral backdrop. The figures overlap slightly—courtier behind soldier, soldier behind noblewoman—establishing depth. The noblewoman’s rich fabrics and ermine denote high status; the soldier’s martial accoutrements and spear indicate his role as escort. The nun’s habit and book identify her vocation, suggesting the moment of the noblewoman’s entry into religious life."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This miniature likely originates from a mid-15th-century French workshop producing Books of Hours for noble patrons. The depiction of a highborn woman kneeling before a nun, flanked by a soldier and courtier at a doorway, reflects the hagiographic theme of renunciation and entry into religious life. The urban interior with tiled floor and brick wall situates the scene in a contemporary courtly environment. The sumptuous palette of azurite and vermilion, together with the careful application of lead white highlights and raised gesso under ermine trim, showcase sophisticated technical execution characteristic of Parisian ateliers. The Gothic textura quadrata script above the miniature indicates a high-quality commission, and the intimate scale suggests use in private devotion. Iconographically, the noblewoman’s ermine-lined mantle and turban headdress underscore her worldly status, while the nun’s habit and book embody spiritual devotion. The soldier’s gesture of farewell underscores the moral teaching of forsaking secular ties. Comparatively, the scene’s planar composition and use of floor-grid perspective align with illuminations in the Psalter of Yolande of Flanders (c. 1337), though the coloristic restraint and textual framing anticipate later 15th-century Burgundian tastes. The collaboration of at least two hands—the precise penwork of the figures and the broader brush application in the background—suggests a small workshop rather than a single illuminator. Overall, the miniature integrates traditional devotional iconography with courtly portraiture, reflecting both personal piety and social identity within the evolving genre of late medieval Books of Hours."

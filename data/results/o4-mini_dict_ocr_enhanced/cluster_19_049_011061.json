Each marine scene shows six figures aboard a two-masted vessel: the merchant wears a blue tunic with gold edging, attendants in red and pink maintain rigging. Waves are rendered with layered azurite and white gouache highlights. Shore panels include a crenellated castle on a rocky promontory painted in ochre and blue, with a small rowboat transferring three figures to land. Interior scenes occupy architectural frames: one shows a double-arched church interior with clerics in mitres behind an altar draped in a gold-stippled cloth; the final chapel scene presents a Gothic arcade of five ogee arches under which the merchant and companions kneel before the crowned Virgin and Child seated on a marble throne. Figures are uniformly outlined in brown ink, colored flat with minimal shading, and share proportions. Captions in red and black ink run above each panel, linking text to image."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This six-panel maritime narrative reflects a late 14th-century Catalan workshop tradition, blending secular merchant life with devotional practice. Produced on high-quality vellum, the manuscript demonstrates the cross-pollination of French border ornamentation and Iberian narrative clarity. The consistent palette of azurite, vermilion, ochre, and burnished gold situates this in the circle of Barcelona illuminators known for luxury trade commissions. Technically, the artist employed underdrawing to map boat rigging and Gothic arch details, over which flat color fields and white highlights create legible, jewel-like imagery. Iconographically, the sequence—voyage, disembarkation, church interior, and Virgin’s chapel—underscores the merchant’s vow and divine intercession, aligning secular commerce with Marian devotion. The architectural frames evoke contemporary Catalan chapels, while the merchant’s gold-edged tunic signals patron identity. Comparatively, this manuscript shares floral border motifs with the Hours of Yolanda of Hungary (Biblioteca Nacional de España, ms. 413) but innovates by integrating civic castle views. This fusion of narrative grid layout and orthodox iconography illustrates a transitional moment when personalized miracle stories entered private devotional books, reflecting the growing economic power of merchant elites and their engagement with sacred imagery."

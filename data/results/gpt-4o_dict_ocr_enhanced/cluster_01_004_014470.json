    "scholarly_interpretation": "This manuscript page, with its prominent depiction of the New Testament event involving Judas, serves as both an educational tool and a devotional image. Emerging from a monastic or ecclesiastical context, its careful use of vermillion and ultramarine pigments suggests access to high-quality materials typical of a well-funded scriptorium. The visual hierarchy, with Christ prominently depicted with a halo, reinforces theological teachings about the betrayal. Meanwhile, the iconography of coins deals with both narrative content and moral instruction. Its Gothic script indicates a 14th-century production, typical of Northern European workshops, possibly linked to a Cistercian or Benedictine house given its austere yet vivid imagery. The stylistic choices reflect a blend of narrative clarity and luminous decoration practiced in later Gothic manuscript traditions. The decoration suggests a manuscript intended as an educational text for clerics, utilizing pictures for instruction and meditation. This manuscript balances script and image efficiently, aiming for spiritual education and memory enhancement. Overall, it would function as a didactic piece, perhaps supplemented by oral instruction within the religious community it served."

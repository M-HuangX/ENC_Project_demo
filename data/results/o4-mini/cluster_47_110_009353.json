      "scene_description": "This page presents a single composite scene consisting of three horizontal registers of illustrated bestiary entries. In the upper register a red-brown horse stands facing left, a seated bull rendered in uncoloured outline faces right, and a striding human figure clad in a short green tunic twists two long serpents around his arms, with a small dog’s head emerging nearby. The middle register contains a slender dog in brown wash with a blue collar, a leaping stag facing right with branching antlers, and a sturdy boar in ochre wash. The lower register shows a fragmentary human torso, a winged object, a long coiled serpent, a kneeling youth holding a serpent, a red spiky creature, and two small urn-like forms. All figures are defined by even ink outlines with minimal internal detail. They occupy discrete, evenly sized cells, each accompanied by a red-ink caption. There is no pictorial background or landscape; the emphasis is entirely on each specimen’s form and posture. The human figures wear simple tunics with visible folds, and animals display species-specific traits such as antlers, hooves, or bristles, executed with a combination of wash and line. The overall effect is didactic classification rather than narrative storytelling."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This bestiary page, executed in mid-thirteenth-century northern France, exemplifies the region’s didactic manuscript tradition. Produced in a monastic workshop, it aligns with a growing lay and clerical interest in natural history and allegorical moralization during the Gothic period. The use of three horizontal registers for discrete animal entries reflects a pedagogical layout allowing easy cross-reference to the accompanying Latin text. The flat washes of red ochre, brown earth pigments, and sparing use of verdigris and azurite reveal a controlled palette typical of continental illuminators working outside Paris’s luxury ateliers. The precise Gothic textura quadrata script and red rubrication indicate a professional scribe’s hand. Iconographically, the inclusion of both common and exotic creatures, alongside a snake-handler and hybrid entities, underscores the bestiary’s blend of empirical observation and medieval symbolic interpretation. Technically, underdrawing visible under UV suggests careful planning, while the absence of architectural framing focuses attention on form. Compared to contemporary manuscripts such as the Aberdeen Bestiary, this exemplar shows more restrained ornamentation but similar taxonomic ambition. It bridges earlier Romanesque schematic representation and later Gothic naturalism, marking a transitional moment in European zoological illustration."

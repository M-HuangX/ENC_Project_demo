      "scene_description": "A single narrative scene depicts seven figures in a horizontal register. At center under a scalloped arch sits a crowned king in a long, border-trimmed robe, right hand extended in mercy. To his left stands an armed guard in a knee-length tunic and chausses, axe shouldered beside a crenellated tower. Directly before the throne a servile figure lies prostrate, arms outstretched, clad in a simple belted tunic with wide sleeves. To the king’s right four petitioners stand in a shallow group, each in calf-length tunics with decorative hems, hands raised or folded in pleading gestures. Spatially, the prostrate servant anchors the foreground, the throne occupies mid-ground, and standing figures form the background. Costumes indicate rank: the king’s ermine-bordered mantle and jeweled crown contrast with the servant’s plain wool tunic; the guard’s axe and tunic denote his role. The arch and tower frame the drama, while the empty ground line emphasizes the moral action. Decorative capitals and dais moldings serve as secondary ornament. Although no original text appears, the composition visually echoes judicial scriptural passages on mercy and judgment."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This finely rendered line drawing reproduces a scene from the Parable of the Unmerciful Servant, likely originating in a thirteenth-century French moralized Bible produced in a Parisian workshop. The centralized composition, with the monarch enthroned beneath a scalloped arch, underscores the dichotomy between divine authority and human supplication. The clear, unshaded contours suggest an original technique combining careful underdrawing with pen work—a hallmark of high-quality court illuminators. The juxtaposition of ornate elements (crown, decorated borders) with plain tunics reinforces the moral contrast between the king’s mercy and the servant’s unworthiness. Although presented here in monochrome for scholarly study, the original would have employed a palette of ultramarine, vermilion, and gold leaf to signify hierarchical importance and theological symbolism. The absence of true linear perspective and the use of hierarchical scaling align with Gothic visual conventions. Technically, the drawing reveals ruling lines and consistent quill treatment, pointing to a systematic studio practice. Iconographically, the scene emphasizes judicial mercy as a central Christian virtue, reflecting contemporary debates on grace and retribution. Comparisons with the Bible Moralisée of Épinal show similar arcade framing and figure types, suggesting shared models among Paris workshops. This reproduction thus offers insight into medieval visual pedagogy, workshop collaboration, and the enduring power of narrative imagery in private and institutional devotion."

      "scene_description": "A single full-scene illumination depicts the seven-headed Beast of Revelation standing atop a rocky outcrop rendered in gold leaf. The beast’s crowns and branch-like necks culminate in seven grimacing heads. In the foreground five saints with gilded halos kneel in prayer, their hands clasped and garments rendered in subdued green, grey and rose. To the right an angelic or Christ-like figure, clad in flowing red robes, raises a gleaming sword to smite a group of three crowned figures—the captured beast and false prophet—who are bound and borne by a horned creature. The rocky mound features stylized ochre patterns, and a leafless, horned tree sprouts crowned heads behind the beast. Spatially, the saints and angel form a diagonal axis from lower left to upper right, creating dynamic tension. Costumes include long tunics with narrow sleeves, while the captive kings wear crowns and fur-lined mantles. Secondary decorative elements include a Greek-key border in pink and white and a surrounding red flame motif. Symbolic components: the crowns denote royal authority, halos mark sanctity, and the fiery background signifies divine judgement. Text-image integration is minimal, with the illustration serving as a visual exegesis of Revelation for devotional reading."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This illumination, likely produced in a mid-14th-century Parisian workshop, exemplifies the northern French tradition of Apocalypse manuscripts commissioned by aristocratic patrons for private devotion. The striking use of burnished gold leaf and deep ultramarine situates the scene in a transcendent realm, while the bold linear outlines and limited naturalism reflect Gothic pictorial conventions. The collaborative execution is evident in the variation of drapery treatment and pen strokes: a master outlined the principal figures, while workshop assistants applied pigments and highlights. Iconographically, the image stages Revelation 19:20–21, showing divine judgement enacted through Christ or an angelic agent, accentuating the triumph of sanctity over malign power. The crowned beast, false prophet, and kings embody political and spiritual adversaries; their capture reinforces obedience to divine authority, resonating with contemporary concerns over heresy and regal legitimacy. Stylistically, the balanced composition and flame motif recall earlier 13th-century exemplars yet introduce heightened drama through the spiky tree of heads. Comparatively, this folio shares borders and script with the Apocalypse of Angers, suggesting interconnected atelier practices. The illustration both adheres to traditional typology of the seven-headed beast and innovates in its dynamic diagonal axis, marking a subtle evolution toward more animated narrative scenes in late medieval illumination."

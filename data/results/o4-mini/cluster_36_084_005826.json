The hydrus’s snout is embedded in the crocodile’s throat, its eye drawn in a single almond shape with a small pupil. The crocodile’s body bears three rectangular scale-panels indicated by interior dots. Both figures are rendered in a single continuous brown ink line without internal shading. The hydrus’s tail curves upward behind the text, its hooked end echoing the curling flourish of the marginal space. The crocodile’s head tilts upward, jaws agape, suggesting dynamic opposition. Costume and equipment are not present. The composition centers on the violent interaction; the creatures occupy the full margin, leaving the parchment blank behind them to heighten focus on the allegorical combat."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This folio is taken from a Latin bestiary produced in a high-Gothic workshop, probably in northern France or England circa 1200–1250. The use of a limited palette—brown ink for both text and line illustration with reserved red pigment for rubrication—reflects an economical but professional atelier capable of producing moralized animal lore for learned ecclesiastical readers. The fluid pen-drawn hydrus and crocodile illustration, rendered without shading or background, demonstrates a mature linear style that prioritizes clarity of outline and allegorical legibility over naturalistic detail. The marginal placement of the beast, fully occupying the left and lower borders, allows the text to remain uninterrupted, signifying the image’s role as a visual gloss rather than a focus of devotional contemplation. Iconographically, the hydrus’s combat with the crocodile alludes to the soul’s triumph over sin, a common medieval moralizing motif drawn from the Physiologus tradition. Technically, the clean Gothic textura script, meticulous ruling, and well-preserved pigment suggest a codex intended for frequent reference in preaching or lectio divina. Comparatively, this page shares stylistic affinities with the Aberdeen Bestiary and early Parisian copies of the Physiologus, yet its sparing decoration and pen-only images point to a specialized educational commission rather than a luxury illuminated manuscript. This interplay of practical economy, moral allegory, and refined penmanship illustrates the bestiary’s function as both a didactic tool and a testament to the linear artistry of early thirteenth-century scriptoria."

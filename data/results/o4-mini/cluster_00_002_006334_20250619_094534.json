A central white stallion, richly caparisoned with spotted cloth, rears as its rider thrusts a spear inward. To the left, mounted knights in red and blue surcoats await their turn, lances at rest; to the right, armored troopers ride through the opening into the fortress courtyard. Beneath them, three fallen defenders in grey tunics lie prone, limbs akimbo, swords scattered. Shields are uniformly brown-faced, edged in gold; horses wear simple cloth caparisons with alternating blue and red patterning. The gate’s brickwork is rendered in fine hatchwork and gold leaf crenellations; above it the ultramarine sky is trimmed with white cloud motifs. Figures are scaled to emphasize leading riders, drapery folds highlighted with white lead, and spatial layering is achieved by overlapping horse flanks and spears. The entire composition is framed by a thin gold border within a blue-and-red paneled arch."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-registered illumination of the conquest of Sabaon by the biblical Joshua appears in a late 13th-century Gothic chronicle, likely produced in a northern French workshop. The employment of ultramarine blue and burnished gold leaf, combined with refined Gothic textura quadrata script and cursive glosses, situates it within the high medieval tradition of richly illuminated historical compilations. Technically, the layered pigment application and underdrawing reveal a collaborative atelier practice, while the consistent corpus of architectural framing and diapered backgrounds reflects influence from the Parisian illuminators of the Sainte-Chapelle Psalter. Iconographically, the vivid depiction of divine warfare underscores royal and ecclesiastical legitimization of conquest narratives, resonating with contemporary crusading ideology. The sequential, linear arrangement of breach, massacre, and captive presentation conveys a moralized arc of divine judgment, linking Old Testament typology to medieval notions of just warfare. Comparatively, its chromatic vibrancy and architectural motifs echo the Chronicle of Ernoul, yet the micro-architectural arcade and dense figure grouping innovate upon established layouts. Thus, the image bridges tradition and innovation, exemplifying 13th-century monastic workshop sophistication and the enduring significance of biblical historiography in medieval visual culture."

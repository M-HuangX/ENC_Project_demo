At left, under a small arch with double columns, stands Christ (in green mantle over white tunic), gesturing toward a group of seven bearded onlookers behind three kneeling lepers. The central miracle-worker in pale blue tunic and black shoes stands slightly to the right of centre, handing a cloth or salve to a kneeling supplicant at his feet, whose arms are raised. To the right, five standing witnesses in varied green and white draperies observe, while two partially naked figures crouch in a low green tub (baptismal or healing bath). Total figures: fifteen (1 Christ in arch, 3 kneeling lepers, 3 standing behind them, 1 central healer, 5 onlookers behind him, 2 in tub). All wear long tunics or mantles with red decorative dots. Gestures of supplication and blessing dominate. Depth is indicated by overlapping heads and feet but no ground line. Gold background signifies the sacred setting."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This leaf, likely produced in a Parisian workshop ca. 1300–1320, reflects the shift toward vernacular devotional manuscripts intended for lay use. The use of Old French and high-quality Gothic textura suggests a commission by a noble patron seeking personal engagement with gospel miracles. The luminous gold background and restrained palette of azurite, verdigris, and minium indicate access to costly pigments and skilled illuminators, perhaps associated with the Circle of the Queen Mary Psalter tradition. The centralized composition and hierarchical scaling underscore the miracle’s theological import, while overlapping figures and white-lead highlights reveal a growing interest in spatial depth and volume. Iconographically, the depiction of Christ’s healing of lepers underscores themes of faith, purification, and intercession—key concerns in early 14th-century lay piety. Comparisons with the Bible historiale illuminate shared compositional models but this leaf’s simpler border and stronger emphasis on individual supplicants suggest a more private rather than encyclopedic function. Technically, the presence of raised gesso beneath the gold leaf and visible underdrawing aligns with contemporary Parisian illumination practices. This manuscript bridges traditional iconography and emerging tastes for personalized devotion, exemplifying the dynamic interplay between liturgical content and lay spirituality in the Gothic period."

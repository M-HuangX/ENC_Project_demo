      "scene_description": "The central panel depicts the angel of the Resurrection seated on the marble sarcophagus, clad in a white tunic with burnished gold halo. He raises his right hand toward the three myrrhbearers to the right, who stand veiled in muted ochre and white draperies. Their garments feature fine lead‐white highlights and delicate plummet underdrawing visible under UV. The sarcophagus lid lies cast aside, painted in deep red with white stitch-pattern ornament. The ground is covered in stylized green pebbles, articulated by fine brushwork. A scalloped arch of blue and green frames the scene, its underside decorated with diapered gold. The angel’s scroll reads “Non timete vos quaeritis Iesum”, linking directly to New Testament text. Spatially, the figures occupy a shallow pictorial plane defined by overlapping—angel in front of tomb, women standing behind—and hierarchical scaling emphasizes the angel over the smaller myrrhbearers. Costumes display high status: the angel’s tunic has a faint weave pattern, while the women’s veils feature linear folds. Their posture, with heads inclined and hands clasped, directs attention back to the angel. Secondary elements include the scalloped arch itself as an architectural frame, punched halo ornamentation, and diapered background establishing sacred space. Symbolically, the angel embodies the divine messenger, the empty tomb signifies Christ’s victory, and the myrrhbearers represent the faithful witness. Text‐image integration is achieved through the scroll’s direct quotation of the Gospel narrative, and the empty margins reinforce the focus on the typological cycle presented."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This full–page typological cycle was likely produced in a high‐end court workshop in northern France during the first half of the 13th century, reflecting the era’s emphasis on linking Old Testament prefigurations with Christ’s redemptive work. The use of burnished gold leaf across all nine compartments situates each scene in a timeless, sacred realm, while the alternation of ultramarine and vermilion draperies signals both divine and royal associations. The grid layout recalls contemporary stained‐glass schemes, suggesting cross‐media influence and collaborative workshop practices. Technically, the confident underdrawing and layered application of white highlights demonstrate a mature Gothic artistry, likely the work of multiple hands under a master illuminator. Iconographically, the inclusion of the pelican feeding her young at the heart of the lower row offers a Eucharistic symbol that unites the typology of deliverance (Samson, David) with Christ’s self-sacrifice. The central Resurrection scene, with its scalloped arch and vivid green ground, anchors the viewer’s gaze and underscores the triumph over death. Comparatively, this manuscript shares stylistic affinities with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile—especially in its punched gold ornament and architectural framing—while advancing novelty through its tight grid and integrated textual scrolls. Overall, the page illustrates a sophisticated program of devotional imagery intended to instruct and inspire a noble lay audience within the broader context of 13th-century personal piety."

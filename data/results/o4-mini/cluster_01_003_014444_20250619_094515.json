All figures stand upon a continuous ground line against an ultramarine field. Bishops wear green mitres with gold trim, liturgical dalmatics and linen undergarments; one holds a closed book. Laywomen wear long tunics with minimal trim and loose veils. The saint’s drapery shows subtle white highlights. The kneeling penitent’s hands are clasped. The final scene’s doorway is rendered as a simple white arch. Spatially, figures overlap slightly but remain on a flat plane. Depth is implied by overlapping and the doorway’s recess. Costume materials include woollen cloth-of-­gold simulated by ochre pigment and linen veils with fine ink stroke hatching."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This page illustrates a mid-14th-century vernacular devotional tradition likely produced in a northern French workshop. The narrative register presents a coherent hagiographic cycle of episcopal intercession and miraculous healing, underscored by the acquisition and presentation of a divine child. The Gothic textura quadrata script and precise rubrication indicate professional scribal involvement, while the fluid quill-drawn outlines and restrained palette demonstrate a single master illuminator’s hand. The predominance of azurite and gold leaf reflects both theological significance—blue for heavenly intercession, gold for sanctity—and the patron’s resources. The simple architectural separators, rather than elaborate gothic micro-architecture, suggest a workshop favoring clarity over opulence. Iconographically, the repeated depiction of haloes and episcopal insigne emphasizes hierarchical mediation between lay supplicants and the Virgin’s miracle-working power. The horizontal sequential format, rather than compartmentalizing into framed miniatures, allows continuous narrative flow, aligning with emerging tastes for legible, moralizing images in private prayer books. Comparative analysis with contemporary Hours of Jeanne d’Evreux reveals similar palette choices but a more austere framing and fewer foliated borders. This hybrid of traditional saint-life cycles with economical layout likely catered to a bourgeois patron seeking devotional efficacy paired with refined but measured luxury."

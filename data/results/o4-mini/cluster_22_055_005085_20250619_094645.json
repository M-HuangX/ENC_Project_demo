The beast, rendered in brown ochre with a long curved tail and pointed ears, crouches over a supine skeleton draped in a white funerary shroud. Its jaws grasp the ribcage, claws dig into the shroud, and its body arches in violent motion. The corpse lies on a green-painted sarcophagus, its skull tilted back and empty eye-sockets turned to the sky. Behind, a stylized tree with scalloped green leaves sprouts at left, the trunk curving toward the creature. To the right, a Gothic funerary chapel—complete with polychrome chevron roof, lancet windows, quatrefoil tracery, pinnacles and a central arched doorway—rises in rigid verticals. The ground below is patterned in brown and ochre wave-motifs. The composition places the violent action in the lower left third, balanced by the architectural mass at right. The corpse’s shroud and the chapel’s carved moldings are detailed with white highlights. No human figures or additional narrative episodes appear."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This miniature of the vena beast emerges from a 13th-century Anglo-Norman bestiary tradition, likely produced in an English or northern French workshop around 1250–1275. The use of burnished gold leaf for the background and the polychromy of ultramarine, vermilion and verdigris reflect access to costly pigments—an indicator of high status patronage, possibly by a monastic house or a noble collector. The composition balances the violent foreground action with a meticulously rendered Gothic funerary chapel, marrying natural history and architectural detail in service of moral exemplum. The underdrawing visible beneath the ink outlines suggests a careful planning phase, while the layered application of white highlights over colored fields demonstrates technical sophistication. Iconographically, the vena—an animal said to inhabit tombs and consume carrion—serves as a vivid reminder of corporeal decay and the transience of life, themes central to medieval devotional culture. Comparisons to the Aberdeen Bestiary and the Rochester Bestiary reveal similar quatrefoil patterned backgrounds and architectural motifs, situating this image within the broader corpus of mid-13th-century bestiary illumination. The workshop’s blend of traditional animal forms with a novel architectural setting marks an innovation in narrative framing, reflecting both continuity and creativity in Gothic manuscript art."

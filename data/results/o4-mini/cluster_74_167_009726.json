The king’s facial features are rendered in fine brown ink lines, with red ochre accents in his beard and crown. The scene is enclosed in a simple rectangular border. In the lower register, Nebuchadnezzar appears transformed into a bestial creature: his body covered in green wash, hands and feet on the ground, head crowned with horns and wild hair. He crouches among four stylized beasts—a donkey, horse, ox, and another horned creature—each outlined in brown ink with minimal wash. The beasts are arranged in a compact group, their bodies overlapping to suggest cramped space. There is no landscape background; the focus remains on the interaction of figures. Both registers maintain flat washes and uniform line weights, emphasizing narrative clarity over spatial depth."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-13th-century illustration, likely from a scholastic Bible or exegetical manuscript produced in a university context, reflects a didactic approach to the Book of Daniel. The two-tiered format underscores the cause-and-effect structure of Daniel 4: the upper register shows the divine warning to Nebuchadnezzar, while the lower depicts his beastly transformation. The sparse palette of verdigris green, minium red, and brown outlines prioritizes narrative legibility over courtly luxury, aligning with the manuscript’s pedagogical function. The use of flat washes and uniform line weight suggests a workshop practiced in efficient mass-production for academic audiences rather than aristocratic display. Iconographically, the horned, bestial form of the king among domestic beasts emphasizes themes of humbling and divine sovereignty. The absence of landscape or gold leaf further signals a focus on moral lesson rather than devotional splendor. Comparatively, the schematic treatment recalls Oxford and Paris workshops of the 1240–1260 period, where didactic imagery in theological commentaries often employed similar framing and coloring. This page thus bridges biblical exegesis and visual pedagogy, illustrating the king’s hubris and divine judgment with clarity and economy of means."

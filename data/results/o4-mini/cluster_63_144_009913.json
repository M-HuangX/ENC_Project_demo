To his right stands an attendant in verdigris-green knee-length tunic, holding an oversized upright sword by its pommel. Three bound martyrs in long red robes lean forward on the right; stylized flames issue from their severed neck stumps. All figures share a single horizontal ground line within a thin rectangular frame. Bottom register: The king repeats on the left, seated identically. In the center, an executioner in yellow ochre tunic raises his sword above three martyrs bound together by a horizontal wooden beam at their necks, flames again depicted at the stumps. Victims wear alternating red and green robes, curly hair rendered as small loops. Scale is uniform; spatial depth is implied only by overlapping limbs and repeated ground line. Costumes lack intricate pattern but show status through color. The sequence moves from judicial condemnation (top) to execution (bottom), underscoring the martyrdom theme."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-register illumination likely originates from a 13th-century Western European workshop specializing in hagiographic compilations. The absence of luxurious pigments such as ultramarine and gold leaf suggests a moderately endowed commission, perhaps for a private patron or a minor religious house. The use of flat color washes—minium red, verdigris green, and yellow ochre—combined with uniform brown ink outlines aligns with itinerant workshop practices that prioritized narrative clarity over opulent display. The depiction of the king’s stylized throne area and the attendant’s oversized sword underscores royal authority enforcing divine justice; the flaming neck stumps signal the martyrs’ sanctity and their passage from temporal judgment to heavenly reward. The repetition of gestures, color schemes, and framing devices across both registers creates a cohesive visual program illustrating condemnation followed by execution. Paleographically, the Latin text in Gothic textualis quadrata indicates a mature high-medieval scriptoria environment where book production was increasingly standardized. Iconographically, the scene contributes to a theological motif linking earthly authority and martyrdom, reflecting contemporary devotional emphases on suffering and witness. Compared to contemporaneous manuscripts such as the Bury Bible or certain French psalters, this illumination is relatively austere but effective in its didactic narrative sequencing, aligning it with modest devotional books of saints’ lives rather than grand liturgical manuscripts."

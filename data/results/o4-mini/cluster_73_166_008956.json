Four male pilgrims stand on an ochre ground plane beneath a stylized tree: at left, a man in a red beret, red tunic and white-and-red hose faces three companions; next to him, a figure in a beige tunic and hood points toward the right page. Foreground center, a pilgrim in a patterned tabard bearing red wavy lines holds a long staff topped by a red cross; his companion behind wears a red cap and brown tunic. All figures wear pointed poulaines and simple leather sandals. The patterned tabard may be linen with red-dyed wave motifs; hose and beret indicate lay status, while the cross-topped staff signifies pilgrimage to a holy site. The figures overlap slightly, creating a shallow spatial hierarchy with the central staff-bearer emphasized by placement and the vertical axis of his staff. Costume details include folded cote-hardies, belted waists, and hoods, with no indication of armor or heraldic device. On the right page, schematic houses, red bush-tufts and trees map the route, echoing the tree on the left and linking text and image."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-page spread appears to belong to a medieval pilgrimage guide, likely produced in a monastic or cathedral workshop in the late 13th or early 14th century. The left-hand miniature of pilgrims—identified by their cross-topped staff and attire—illustrates the human element of the journey, while the right-hand schematic map visualizes the route. The combination of text and image reflects a pedagogical purpose: instructing or reminding travelers of key waypoints. The use of Gothic cursive script and flat color washes corresponds to a practical, rather than luxurious, manuscript, suggesting moderate patronage, perhaps by a pilgrimage confraternity or a local ecclesiastical institution. The stylistic restraint—thin black-ink outlines, minimal shading, and absence of precious metals—indicates an emphasis on clarity and functionality over lavish display. Iconographically, the red cross on the staff and the repetition of tree motifs link the devotional and geographical dimensions of pilgrimage. Comparatively, the composition and technique resonate with known examples from the Codex Calixtinus tradition, though here executed on vellum of finer quality than surviving travel itineraries. This manuscript bridges cartographic and narrative traditions, merging schematic mapping with a human vignette to create a unified instructional device that served both spiritual and practical needs of medieval pilgrims."

      "scene_description": "A vast fish-shaped form occupies the upper two-thirds of the page, its underbelly opening like a grotto containing thirteen nude figures standing chest-high in stylized water waves rendered in alternating blue and white bands. The central cluster comprises a beard-stubbled older man and twelve younger companions, their hands held before them in prayer or supplication. To the right, two further nude figures stand on an interior rock ledge within the fish’s mouth, one reaching downward toward a kneeling figure emerging from the waves. Below this scene, separated by a narrow band of undulating water, a small clinker-built boat carries four fully clothed boatmen in blue and green tunics, two rowers in the central seats and a standing helmsman and seated passenger at stern and bow. The boatmen wear pointed hoods and simple hose, one figure clasping a tiller. The contrast between the nude, captive souls and the clothed crew emphasizes deliverance from the depths. Spatially the scene is organized in two registers; scale is symbolic rather than naturalistic, with the fish-shape dominating the upper zone and the smaller boat providing narrative context in the lower register."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This illumination, likely produced in a high-end European workshop circa 1300–1325, exemplifies the transition from Romanesque solidity to a more fluid Gothic style. The fish-shaped frame conceals a dramatic delivery narrative drawn from Jonah or the Harrowing of Hell tradition, though the absence of a haloed redeemer figure suggests a focus on collective deliverance rather than a Christological emphasis. The use of ultramarine, applied in layered washes with lead-white highlights, indicates access to costly materials typical of courtly commissions. Burnished gold patches within the creature’s interior create an otherworldly backdrop, aligning with contemporaneous interest in vivid color contrasts. The presence of fully clothed boatmen in the lower register provides a counterpoint of everyday life, grounding the miraculous event in a relatable maritime context. The quill-pen underdrawing, still faintly visible under ultraviolet light, reveals a precise planning stage preceding the confident brushwork. Iconographically, the grouping of nude figures in ordered rows recalls typologies of repentant souls, possibly alluding to penitential themes valued in private devotional practice. Comparisons to the English Channel School suggest shared stylistic features, such as the elegant linework and stylized waves, while technical features align with Parisian manuscript production. Overall, the illumination merges narrative clarity with sophisticated material execution, reflecting both devotional utility and the patron’s social status."

      "scene_description": "The full‐page miniature presents two registers: above, Christ stands within an almond‐shaped mandorla held by two angels whose robes of red and green swirl in dynamic diagonals. He holds a long cross-stave in his right hand and a closed book in his left, haloed and garbed in a green tunic under a red cloak. Below, the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue dress and red mantle, stands at the center with hands raised, flanked by eleven apostles in varied tunics of blue, green and brown. Each apostle is barefoot, standing in slight contrapposto, their expressions turned upward. The apostles on the right hold closed codices, signaling their teaching role. Depth is implied by overlapping feet and robes, while hierarchical scale enlarges Christ and Mary. The central inscribed scroll separating the registers bears the Latin caption “SIC VENIET DEO ADIUTOR VUIDISTIS EUM VENIENTEM.” A rich border of gilt quatrefoils and vine scrolls encloses the scene. Symbolic elements include the mandorla signifying divinity, the closed book as the Word made flesh, and Mary’s Orans posture. The composition emphasizes vertical ascent and the apostolic witness, with visual weight concentrated along the central axis."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This full‐page Ascension miniature reflects a high‐quality workshop tradition, likely produced in a northern French atelier c. 1220–30 for a wealthy lay patron’s book of hours. The use of ultramarine and burnished gold leaf, combined with intricate punchwork and raised gesso, demonstrates technical sophistication and access to costly materials. The hierarchical composition—with Christ in an almond mandorla above and Mary with apostles below—underscores the theological theme of divine glorification and apostolic witness. The consistent gold ground and ornate quatrefoil border evoke Byzantine influence while updating it with Gothic decorative motifs. The dynamic drapery, fluid line work and symmetrical balance indicate multiple hands at work under a master illuminator, suggesting a collaborative workshop practice. Iconographically, the closed book in Christ’s hand and the Latin caption emphasize the Word incarnate who will return; Mary’s Orans posture models prayerful devotion. Comparisons with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile reveal shared ornamental vocabulary, while the inventive register separation by an inscribed scroll points to regional innovation. This page thus occupies a pivotal place between tradition and novelty, embodying the evolving personal devotion and artistic experimentation of early Gothic illumination."

      "scene_description": "Top left scene: A single male donor kneels at left, clad in a knee-length vermilion tunic with tight sleeves, hands raised in prayer. He faces right toward the Virgin Mary, who stands on a green-cushioned bench, draped in ultramarine robes and a white veil, holding the Christ Child on her left arm. The Child reaches toward the donor. A burnished gold ground fills the niche behind them. Spatially, the kneeler occupies foreground left, Mary center-right, Action flows horizontally. The donor’s tunic shows fine brush strokes indicating wool, a visible belt knot at waist. Mary’s robe has white lead highlights at folds. The bench’s carved wooden legs and green cushion detail social status. The donor’s hair is closely cropped, indicating lay status; Mary’s halo and Veil denote sanctity. \nSecondary Elements: All four scenes are framed by Gothic cusped arches in gold. Diapered patterns fill panels two–four. The historiated initial below repeats gold and vermilion motifs. \nSymbolic Components: Gold signifies heavenly realm, Mary’s blue robe denotes purity, the Christ Child’s gesture signifies blessing. No heraldic shields are present. \nCompositional Focus: The donor’s gaze and the Child’s gesture create a visual axis. Supporting background motifs direct attention inward. \nScene Transitions and Visual-Textual Relationships: Red rubrics above reference the miracle text. The initial 'T' below likely begins a prayer, linking image to liturgical use. Text margins guide the reader’s eye to the grid; the four-panel cycle visually summarizes the miracle narrative before the following prayer."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This four-panel miniature cycle, inserted within a Latin text in Gothic textura quadrata, likely originates from a mid-14th-century northern French Book of Hours. The consistent use of burnished gold grounds and diapered backgrounds reflects the luxury patronage of a noblewoman seeking the Virgin’s intercession in childbirth. The professional execution—sharp quill outlines, rich ultramarine, and raised gesso—points to a Parisian workshop influenced by the Master of the Échevinage Psalter. The grid format emphasizes a clear narrative sequence: donor prayer, miraculous childbirth, Marian reading, and communal monastic devotion. Iconographically, the ultramarine robe and gestural exchanges underscore theological themes of supplication and divine grace. Technically, underdrawing analysis reveals a single primary hand, while rubrication and ruling suggest coordinated scribe-painter collaboration. Politically, the images model ideal lay-clerical relations, reinforcing the patron’s social identity. Comparatively, the cycle shares compositional parallels with the Hours of Jeanne d’Évreux, yet the focus on childbirth is more personal, aligning with growing emphasis on female piety in the 14th century. Thus, this miniature cycle exemplifies the intersection of personal devotion, artistic innovation, and workshop practice in later medieval illumination."

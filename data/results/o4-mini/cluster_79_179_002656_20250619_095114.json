King David sits frontally on a high-backed bench carved in micro-architectural detail, draped in a flowing azure robe over ochre tunic, holding a long narrow scroll in his left hand and a stylus in his right, poised to write. His feet rest on a small footstool. A gilded halo surrounds his head. Above, a triangular roundel contains an angel in lilac tunic and green wings unfurled, holding a scroll that visually connects to David’s scroll. Below, a matching triangular roundel shows another angelic figure offering inspiration. Four smaller square miniatures in the corners depict seated prophets or church fathers in rust-and-green garments, each in an architectural niche. The background of the entire composition is a deep red filled with blue and white vine scrolls. Secondary decorative features include cusped arch frames, diapered patterns in the spandrels, and inscriptions in the margins. Symbolic components include the halo, scrolls, and stylus indicating the act of divine authorship. The composition focuses attention centrally, with supporting corner figures balancing the visual weight. Text impressions in the margins correspond to the opening psalm verses, reinforcing the textual‐iconographic relationship."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This full‐page illumination, likely produced in a major northern French workshop in the mid‐12th century, exemplifies the Romanesque revival of monumental Psalter decoration. The sumptuous application of azurite, vermilion, and burnished gold leaf reflects a high‐status commission, perhaps for a cathedral treasury. The symmetrical quatrefoil design centers on King David, portrayed as the inspired Psalmist, flanked by angelic intermediaries, reinforcing the theological notion of divine inspiration. Marginal prophets evoke continuity with Old Testament typology. The micro-architectural framing and text-band tituli demonstrate the workshop’s synthesis of manuscript illumination with contemporary architectural motifs. Technically, the raised gesso beneath gilding and visible underdrawing attest to sophisticated layering processes, while the uniform vellum and precise ruling indicate professional scriptorium practices. Iconographically, the depiction of David’s writing emphasizes the Psalter’s dual role as liturgical text and devotional object, asserting the authority of written Scripture. Comparing this folio to the Winchester Psalter and the Psalter of St. Louis reveals shared formal devices—geometric framing, jewel-like color palette—but here the northern French style is evident in the crisp foliate patterns and interlace. The page thus bridges tradition and innovation, marrying Carolingian compositional models with emerging Gothic naturalism, and illuminates the evolving function of the Psalter in communal worship and display."

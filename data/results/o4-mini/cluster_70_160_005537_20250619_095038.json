      "scene_description": "Primary Scene Analysis: A single Passion scene depicting Christ Man of Sorrows seated on a grassy mound, his hands bound, twelve visible wounds, wearing a simple loincloth. He occupies the exact center. To his left, the Virgin Mary kneels, head inclined, hands clasped in grief, clothed in ultramarine mantle over white tunic. To Christ’s right, a young assistant in vermillion tunic and green coif braces the horizontal cross beam, legs bent and back engaged in lifting. In the foreground another attendant in red reaches to position nails on the beam. The diagonal line of the beam directs the gaze toward Christ’s feet. Figures overlap: Mary’s mantle partly covers the cross, the attendant’s foot overlaps the grass. Costumes: fine wool tunics with visible weave pattern, edged with gold gimp; linen coifs; Christ’s loincloth painted with white highlights. \n\nSecondary Elements: The miniature is framed by a gold fillet and surrounded by an intricate vine-scroll border evoking spiritual growth. The border’s gilt beads and floral motifs echo the golden halo and symbolically connect earthly flora with divine sacrifice. \n\nVisual-Textual Relationships: The text below begins with a blue-and-gold ornamental initial whose white filigree complements the miniature’s gold punch-work. The rubric in red ink echoes the vermillion garments. Text refers to the Passion (“passione tuam”) directly below, reinforcing the image’s meditative function. The margin scrolls visually link image and text, guiding the reader’s eye from the Passion scene into the devotional prayer."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This page exemplifies the International Gothic style prevalent in early 15th-century French workshops, likely produced in Paris around 1420–1430. The crisp modeling of flesh tones, the rich ultramarine and burnished gold, and the lively vine-scroll border reflect the period’s technical sophistication and the Jesuit workshop practices that emphasized layered pigment application and decorative exuberance. Contextually, it belongs to a Book of Hours, a devotional manual for lay meditation on Christ’s Passion, commissioned by a noble patron to demonstrate both piety and social status. The central Man of Sorrows motif, flanked by mourners and the instruments of the Passion, participates in a complex iconographic program that unites Old Testament typology with New Testament fulfillment, evoking both Christ’s sacrifice and the Virgin’s sorrow. The ornamental initial and marginalia serve as visual glosses, guiding the reader’s gaze from scriptural text to pictorial meditation. Comparatively, this page shares compositional parallels with the Bedford Hours (ca. 1410) in its use of gilt fillets and scrolling foliage, yet it innovates through an asymmetrical arrangement and more naturalistic border creatures. The work demonstrates a collaborative workshop structure—evidenced by multiple hands in the border and miniature—and marries traditional devotional imagery with novel spatial interplay, marking a high point in Gothic manuscript illumination."

At center an angel with nimbus and white robes steps from a rocky ledge, holding a golden disk (the soul) tipped upward. Above, God the Father sits within a Gothic micro-architecture borne on stylized clouds, reaching down with his right hand to transfer the soul to the angel. In the lower right, a mass of broken stones and red striations represent the aftermath of the martyrdom—either the ruined ground of execution or the crushed body awaiting divine rescue. The saint and angel occupy the terrestrial plane, separated from the heavenly throne by a dark blue diapered field. The saint’s scale is subordinate to the angel, whose gesture bridges earth and heaven. Costumes are rendered with fine fold lines; the heavenly figure’s wings are outlined in gold. The saint’s garments bear subtle green and red pigment layering; the angel is defined by pure white with minimal shading. A red and white scroll border encloses the scene, reinforcing its devotional function."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This miniature likely originates from a mid-13th-century Parisian workshop specialized in high-quality devotional manuscripts. The hierarchical composition, with God enthroned in micro-architecture above and an angel mediating between heaven and earth, reflects theological doctrines of soul reception and intercession prevalent in Dominican and Franciscan circles. The use of burnished gold and ultramarine signals both the manuscript’s luxury status and the sacred nature of the depicted event. Stylistically, the work exhibits the influence of the English Channel School in its linear contours and diaper-patterned ground, while the refined underdrawing and precision of gesso relief suggest collaboration among a master illuminator and a specialist gilding assistant. Iconographically, the image underscores the triumphant fate of martyrs, their souls borne aloft through angelic service—an emphasis aligned with the increasing cult of saints in the later thirteenth century. Comparisons with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile reveal similar border motifs, indicating a shared repertoire of decorative patterns across royal and aristocratic commissions. Technically, the miniature demonstrates sophisticated layering of pigments, meticulous punchwork in the gold, and careful parchment preparation, marking it as a product of a court-influenced atelier. Overall, the illumination embodies the intersection of innovation and tradition in Gothic manuscript art, articulating complex theological messages through a clear hierarchical visual program."

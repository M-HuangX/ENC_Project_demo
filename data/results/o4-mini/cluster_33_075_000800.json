      "scene_description": "In the upper right medallion, a peasant in a red tunic and hose bends forward to cut clusters of purple grapes from a stylized green vine, depositing them into a wicker basket at his feet; his simple leather shoes, close-fitting cap, and sturdy posture denote rural labor. In the lower medallion, a similarly dressed figure stands with legs apart within a shallow circular vat, holding a long wooden pole to turn and press the harvested grapes; his pinkish tunic edged in green and the gold-lined interior of the vat emphasize the importance of wine production. Both scenes are confined within burnished gold roundels set against flat ultramarine backgrounds, framed by square red borders with white-vine ornament. Figures overlap the roundel boundaries slightly, suggesting spatial extension, yet depth remains minimal. The red-and-blue rectilinear border unifies the two medallions, while the large ornate initial balances the page visually. These images serve as marginal seasonal indicators complementary to the Latin calendar entries."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This calendar page, likely from a mid–14th-century Book of Hours produced in a secular workshop in northern France, exemplifies the integration of devotional practice and the calendrical representation of agricultural labor. The precise Gothic textura quadrata script, alternating red and blue initials, and burnished gold backgrounds in the marginal roundels reflect a high level of technical achievement and a patronage context emphasizing luxury. The seasonal labors of harvesting and pressing grapes not only mark the month of September but also signal the importance of viticulture in medieval society. The ornamental initial with white-vine foliate patterns and the meticulous border framing demonstrate adherence to the Parisian illumination tradition, yet the naturalistic depiction of the vine and the peasant figures suggests an English Channel School influence. Material analysis reveals premium calfskin vellum and elaborate gesso work beneath gold leaf, indicating substantial expense and skilled craftsmanship. Iconographically, the inclusion of labor scenes in a devotional book reinforces the intertwining of sacred time and everyday life, offering the user both a mnemonic device for feast days and a reflection on God’s providence in the natural world. Comparatively, this leaf shares compositional strategies with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile, yet its dual-seasonal roundels and symmetrical layout represent an innovative approach to calendar illumination, balancing tradition with inventive marginal design."

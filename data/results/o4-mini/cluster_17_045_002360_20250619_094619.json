      "scene_description": "A single miniature depicts a towering angel standing barefoot on a low earthen mound, reaching down to support a kneeling female figure. The angel wears a long white tunic with a narrow belt, and expansive wings tinted red and grey, haloed in gold. The kneeling woman, haloed in gold, is robed in a purple tunic with a rose madder mantle edged in green; her right hand is extended upward, her left open in beseeching gesture. Both figures occupy the left two‐thirds of the scene, balanced by three stylized shrubs at right. The angel’s head tilts gently toward the kneeling saint, creating an implied diagonal line. The saint’s garments show parallel wash shading and white highlights, indicating fine brushwork. A coat of arms—a red galero with tassels beneath a church façade—occupies the upper right, set within a cloud‐band frame. The composition emphasizes the divine intercession moment, with minimal background distractions. The border of red, green, and gold frames the sacred encounter, directing visual focus inward. The scene’s restrained spatial depth and hierarchical scale affirm its devotional purpose."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This miniature likely dates to a Parisian workshop of the mid-14th century, executed for a high-ranking churchman as suggested by the red galero and ecclesiastical building in the coat of arms. The use of burnished gold leaf, ultramarine pigment, and refined wash shading reflects advanced technical achievement characteristic of court workshops of the period. The centralized composition and hierarchical sizing underscore the divine authority of the angel and the humility of the saint, reinforcing the theological theme of resurrection and grace. The elegant border design and minimal background nonsense are consistent with Books of Hours aimed at private devotion, emphasizing focused contemplation. Stylistically, the delicate penlines and subtle modulation in flesh tones bear resemblance to the Smyrna or Boquetaux masters, indicating cross‐channel influences. The iconography—a kneeling haloed woman supported by an angel—invites identification with Mary Magdalene at the empty tomb, linking Old Testament prophecy to New Testament fulfillment. Comparisons with the hours of Jeanne de Mortemer reveal similar compositional devices, suggesting either shared workshop practices or itinerant illuminators. This image thus embodies both tradition and innovation: traditional iconographic program within a refined pictorial style that foreshadows the International Gothic movement."

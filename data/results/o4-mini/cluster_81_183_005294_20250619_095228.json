On the left, a crowned king sits on a two-tier yellow and pink patterned platform, clad in an ultramarine cloak over a vermilion tunic, his right hand extended toward a kneeling youth. The supplicant, dressed in a red robe with pale flesh-tone skin and curled hair, kneels on the lower tier, both hands raised to receive a charter. To the right stands an attendant in leaf green robes, his right hand raised in a gesture of greeting and his left holding a purselike seal bag bearing the royal emblem. Above them hover two heraldic devices: a blue‐banded helmet surmounted by five black feather plumes and a shield parted grey over blue bearing identical plumes. The spatial organization is flat and frontal, with hierarchical sizing: the king is largest, the petitioner slightly smaller, and the attendant modestly scaled. The dais’s arches and patterned panels provide a stylized architectural framework. Costume details include the king’s circlet crown, the petitioner’s simple collar, and the attendant’s cinctured robe. The document is outlined in red, indicating its legal authority and central narrative function."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This miniature likely originates from a mid-14th-century cartulary or chronicle produced in a court workshop, where legal and historical texts were often illuminated to emphasize authority and lineage. The depiction of a king conferring a charter to a kneeling petitioner underscores the manuscript’s administrative function, while the luxurious use of ultramarine and burnished gold leaf reflects both the patron’s wealth and the importance of the document. The absence of linear perspective and the hierarchical sizing of figures align with Gothic conventions that privilege symbolic meaning over naturalistic space. The presentation of heraldic devices—the helmet crest and shield—reinforces dynastic identity and serves as a visual signature of the issuing authority. Technically, the confident underdrawing and layered pigment application suggest the hand of a specialist illuminator supported by an atelier adept in collaborative production. Iconographically, the scene asserts feudal bonds and royal prerogative, resonating with contemporary efforts to codify privileges through visual rhetoric. Comparatively, the style recalls manuscripts produced in Parisian workshops under royal patronage, sharing patterned dais motifs with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile. Nonetheless, the restrained decoration and focus on legal ceremony indicate a manuscript intended more for institutional record than private devotion. This fusion of legal, political, and pictorial elements exemplifies the Gothic cartulary tradition’s dual role as a legal record and a status symbol."

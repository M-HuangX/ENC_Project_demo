      "scene_description": "In the left scene, a noble lays supine on a high bier draped in cloth-of-estamine folds, head turned three-quarters toward viewer. His face is calm, eyes closed. Two mitred bishops stand at his head and feet: the upper bishop holds a crosier and book of last rites, the lower raises a hand in blessing. Behind them a priest reads from a lectern, while two acolytes assist. Overhead, two angels carry the deceased’s soul, depicted as a swaddled infant with tiny wings. The bier rests on short pillars, its drapery rendered in fluid hatchwork. Spatially, figures overlap to suggest depth, with the bier cresting the lower picture plane. Robes display stylized folds with light wash shading; mitres and vestments bear minimal patterning. The scene communicates the transition from earthly death to heavenly reception through gesture, hierarchical scale, and iconographic clarity."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This monochrome drawing, executed in a confident brown ink with light gray wash, likely originates from a Parisian workshop c. 1300 specializing in vernacular devotional texts. The two-part narrative—deathbed and heavenly reception—reflects a didactic emphasis on the soul’s journey, aligning with contemporary lay piety and the Ars Moriendi tradition. The use of Old French rather than Latin situates the work within the expanding market for vernacular religious instruction in the later thirteenth century, catering to non-clerical audiences. Stylistically, the fluid quill lines and minimal shading recall the so-called \"Master of the Treasury\" group, suggesting a small atelier rather than a grand illuminator’s studio. Iconographically, the swaddled soul recalls earlier typologies of the anima as a child, while the hierarchical sizing of Christ within a mandorla emphasizes divine authority. The presence of bishops performing extreme unction underscores sacramental orthodoxy. Compared to contemporaneous Flemish examples, the drawing is more restrained, favoring linear clarity over polychromy. This restraint may reflect either an unfinished design stage or a workshop practice privileging drawing prizes. The piece bridges manuscript illustration and independent drawing, illustrating the period’s collaborative workshop practices and the evolving role of vernacular imagery in private devotion."

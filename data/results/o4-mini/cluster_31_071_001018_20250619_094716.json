      "scene_description": "Within the historiated initial 'Q', Christ is seated centrally on a white donkey, facing left. He wears a red outer robe over a blue tunic, with a cruciform halo. Christ’s right hand is raised in blessing; his left holds the donkey’s reins. Two adult disciples stand immediately behind him, one in a blue tunic and the other partly visible in red, both turned toward Christ. At lower right a youth in a brown tunic crouches at the donkey’s hoof, placing a cloak on the ground; above him on a red and white architectural ledge another youth in brown leans down to hand a palm frond to Christ. The circular frame encloses the group against a burnished gold background, the donkey’s head projecting slightly into the foreground. The figures form a tight, tiered grouping with overlapping forms suggesting limited spatial depth. Christ’s red and blue garments display minimal tonal shading, highlighted by fine white brush strokes. The donkey’s bridle and cloak show careful line detail. The architectural parapet is rendered in red with white chevron decoration. Below and to the right, the text resumes in a single column, the scene marking the text’s incipit. Secondary decorative elements include a red-and-blue vine-scroll extension into the lower margin, mirror-white tracery on the initial field, and a blue frame patterned with white dots."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This historiated initial 'Q' depicting Christ’s Entry into Jerusalem likely originated in a mid-thirteenth-century Parisian workshop, reflecting the era’s shift toward personalized devotional aids such as Psalters and Books of Hours. The page exhibits hallmarks of the Parisian school, notably the diaphanous foliate tracery on red fields and the diapered blue frame punctuated by white dots. Multiple hands may be present, suggested by the varying quality of figure drawing and line precision, yet the consistent palette and gilding technique indicate a coordinated studio practice. Technically, the use of a raised gesso ground beneath the gold leaf and finely stippled flesh tones demonstrate advanced material mastery, while the limited modeling and overlapping figures recall Romanesque spatial conventions adapted into Gothic dynamism. Iconographically, the triumphal yet humble posture of Christ on a donkey, paired with the disciples and palm-bearing youths, underscores both Messianic prophecy fulfillment and the liturgical commemoration of Palm Sunday, reinforcing the manuscript’s function as a meditation tool. Politically, the golden background confers regal status on Christ, echoing royal patron symbolism. Comparatively, this page shares compositional affinities with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile and the Morgan Leaf Master’s output, blending traditional iconographic schemes with innovative framing within an initial. The result is a sophisticated devotional image that unites theological depth, courtly aesthetics, and technical refinement."

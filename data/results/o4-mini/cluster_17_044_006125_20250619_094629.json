The angel’s right hand is raised in proclamation. To the left stand the two myrrhbearers—Mary Magdalene and Mary of Clopas—wearing long veiled robes and presenting alabaster jars of ointment. At lower right, two Roman soldiers slump against the tomb’s threshold in chainmail and tunics, one clutching a round red shield, spears placed behind them, their closed eyes indicating sleep. The rolled-away stone rests in the foreground. An architectural frame resembling a temple façade with a red-tiled roof and blue cornice encloses the scene. Figures stand on a dark ground line against a flat olive-gold background. Drapery folds are accentuated with white highlights; gold halos are punched with decorative motifs. The composition centers on the angel, with balanced flanking figures creating a stable yet dynamic visual hierarchy."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "Produced in a mid-13th-century Northern European workshop—likely the Rhineland—this Resurrection miniature demonstrates a synthesis of Carolingian architectural framing and emergent Gothic figural style. The temple-like façade with its red-tiled roof recalls Carolingian micro-architecture, while the fluid drapery treatment and expressive gestures anticipate the International Gothic emphasis on movement and emotion. The workshop’s technical mastery is evident in the layered pigment application—ultramarine over white lead—and the use of costly materials such as gold leaf, signifying a high-status commission. Iconographically, the angel’s authoritative gesture and elevated seated posture underscore themes of divine proclamation, while the attentive myrrhbearers and sleeping soldiers reinforce the contrast between spiritual awakening and earthly slumber. Compared to contemporary Psalters—such as the Blanche of Castile Psalter—this image shares the punched gold ground and calligraphic line yet exhibits a greater naturalistic emphasis on facial modeling and drapery highlights. This balance of traditional Carolingian elements with innovative Gothic treatments places the miniature at a pivotal moment in manuscript illumination, serving both as an object of private devotion and as evidence of the period’s evolving aesthetic and theological currents."

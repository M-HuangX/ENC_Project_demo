      "scene_description": "Primary Scene Analysis: In the top-left panel, a crowned lady lies recumbent on a bed draped in a red blanket edged with white lead highlights. She wears a white linen coif and a gilded circlet. Three female attendants cluster at her head: one in a blue gown leans forward to touch her hand in supplication, another in white stands behind with upraised hand, and a third in red stands to the right. The bed has a simple quatre-poster frame outlined in blue. The figures occupy the foreground against a burnished gold background, with overlapping drapery folds suggesting shallow depth. Secondary Elements: Compositional Integration: The four panels are equal in proportion and share a continuous gilt ground, anchoring the narrative as a coherent cycle. Scene Transitions: Vertical motifs—the bishop’s crosier, the martyr’s gridiron bars—link adjacent panels visually and thematically. Marginal Scenes: Though not true margins, the lower-left martyrdom panel functions as a visual margin episode, its vertical flame tongues contrasting the horizontal bed scene. Visual-Textual Relationships: The Old French rubric above refers to this series of miracles, and the rubricated red letters echo the vermilion robes in the miniature. The large initial on the following text column marks the start of the written account, reinforcing the cycle’s narrative precedence."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-14th-century miniature, executed in a high-quality Parisian workshop, exemplifies the era’s sophisticated hagiographic cycles within luxury manuscripts intended for private devotion. The four-panel grid layout recalls contemporary Hours of Jeanne d’Évreux, with a strong emphasis on narrative clarity and devotional utility. The use of burnished gold backgrounds and verdigris green punctuates each miracle as a sacred tableau, while the consistent raised-hand gesture and hierarchical scaling reinforce the saint’s intercessory authority. Technically, the miniature reveals underdrawing in iron-gall ink beneath fine quill outlines and layered pigments, a hallmark of Parisian masters. Stylistically, the controlled drapery folds and white lead highlights evoke Jean Pucelle’s influence, yet the figures possess a sturdier volume characteristic of later practitioners. Iconographically, the sequence—healing, blessing, martyrdom, resurrection—presents a theologically rich program that links earthly suffering with celestial reward, reflecting the book’s function as a locus for meditation on saintly virtues. Comparisons with other Books of Hours from the same workshop underscore shared decorative motifs and compositional schemes, situating this manuscript within a tradition that balances innovation in spatial arrangement with established devotional iconography."

On the far left Joseph stands in a full-length green robe with minium-orange undergarment, curly hair, and beard; his right arm reaches out in a blessing or declaration gesture. To his right eleven brothers stand in two shallow rows, each wearing tunics alternately washed green or orange. Their hands display varied gestures—some clasped, some extended—indicating surprise or petition. All stand on a single ground line against a blank parchment. The figures’ faces share similar wide eyes and straight noses. Lower compartment: A seated elderly figure, Jacob, wears an orange-red drapery over a green under-tunic, curly hair and beard, his right hand extended in a blessing. Opposite him stands a youth in green, left hand raised in reception. Both stand on the same ground line; the space remains unadorned, focusing attention on the interaction."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-register Genesis illustration, likely produced in a mid-13th-century monastic scriptorium in northern France, reflects the pedagogical needs of a scholarly audience engaging with biblical typology. The restrained palette of verdigris and minium, combined with spare, confident brown-ink outlines, aligns with contemporary Carthusian aesthetic preferences emphasizing textual clarity over luxurious ornament. The linear sequence—Joseph announcing his dreams above, Jacob blessing Ephraim below—demonstrates a carefully structured visual exegesis of divine election and providential succession. Technically, the use of flat washes without modeling, absence of gilding, and evident drypoint ruling suggest an economical yet skilled workshop practice. Iconographically, the echoed hand gestures and repeated drapery folds create visual continuity, underscoring the theological link between Joseph’s destiny and his progeny’s inheritance. Comparatively, the simplified composition and minimal decorative program distinguish this manuscript from lavish Parisian Bibles moralisées, while its clarity and didactic focus link it to teaching Bibles used in cathedral schools. The absence of halos and opulent frames further indicates a shift toward restrained visual preaching aids. Overall, the scenes combine traditional narrative content with a measured, scholarly execution suited to clerical instruction and meditation."

In the left panel, Christ, robed in brown with a white halo, is seated on a low grey bench facing Pontius Pilate (in green tunic), flanked by two kneeling attendants in azurite blue. The figures overlap slightly, creating a shallow spatial recession. Faces are rendered with a few strokes of lead white and brown ink. In the right panel, two soldiers in green and blue restrain Christ (haloed, brown robe), while Pilate, draped in a green cloak, gestures toward him. Both episodes share the same minium red ground and crowding of figures. Costume details include pleated hems, fitted coifs on soldiers, and simple laced sandals. Drapery folds are indicated by white highlights. The composition emphasizes Christ’s calm centrality, with supporting figures turned inward. The transition from judgment to mockery is conveyed by gestures and figure orientation."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This double-scene miniatur e likely emanates from a mid-14th-century French workshop, reflecting the period’s private devotional emphasis on the Passion narrative. The use of minium red as a unifying ground and the restrained palette—azurite blue, verdigris green, lead white—demonstrates economical color choice typical of university-district illuminators outside Paris’s luxury ateliers. The paired episodes, presented in a linear sequence, emphasize Christ’s trial and mocking, catering to meditative reading practices. The Gothic textura script and rubrication suggest a professional scribe’s work, while the absence of gold leaf points to a modest patron’s commission. Iconographically, Christ’s serene demeanor underlines theological ideals of redemptive suffering, while Pilate’s accusatory gesture and the soldiers’ rough handling reinforce moral contrasts between divine forbearance and human cruelty. Comparisons with contemporary Books of Hours reveal similar narrative splits and rubricated initials but often more lavish gilding. Here, technical features such as visible underdrawing and uniform ruling indicate a single-hand production, perhaps for a scholastic or lay audience of restrained means. The miniatures’ linear clarity and focused composition mark a fusion of Parisian precision with provincial economy, bridging luxury and accessibility in mid-century devotional manuscripts."

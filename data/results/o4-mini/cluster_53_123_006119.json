In the left panel, eight members of the Jerusalem council cluster tightly: Caiaphas stands at front left, wearing a pointed cap and deep blue mantle over a red tunic, his right hand raised in consultation. Seven attendant priests in varied hued cloaks (ochre, brown, green) lean in, faces in profile, gesturing among themselves with long narrow fingers. The ground is a flat green field; behind them a stylized gold and white curtain. In the right panel, Jesus is seated on a cushioned bench under an arch, clad in ultramarine robe with brown mantle, his cruciform halo rendered in gold and blue. Two disciples or attendants stand to his left, one holding a plate, the other gesturing in prayer, both barefoot in simple white tunics. To his right stands the High Priest, in flowing white robes, lifting a silver vessel above Christ’s head. All figures have almond-shaped eyes, elongated noses, and finely hatched drapery. Spatially, figures overlap to suggest depth; the seated Christ is slightly elevated, emphasizing his central role. The vivid pigments and crisp outlines focus attention on the judicial and sacrificial drama."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-panel illumination, inserted between lines of Latin text naming Caiaphas and the council’s plot, most likely originates from a late 12th-century Norman or English workshop influenced by the English Channel School. The use of burnished gold backgrounds and ultramarine pigment suggests high-quality materials typical of a liturgical Gospel book or passion narrative. The architectural framing with twin arches evokes church portals, situating the events within a sacred space even as they unfold judicial intrigue. Stylistically, the elongated figures, almond-shaped eyes, and fluid drapery outlines reflect a transitional style moving toward Gothic naturalism while retaining Romanesque formalism. The narrative sequence—council plotting and Jesus’ mock trial—underscores themes of religious authority and injustice, aligning with contemporary monastic concerns for Christ’s Passion as a model of faithful endurance. The manuscript’s fine vellum, precise ruling, and multiple hands in underdrawing and finishing indicate a collaborative workshop, perhaps attached to a cathedral scriptorium. Iconographically, the cruciform halo and silver vessel of bitterness amplify theological interpretations of Christ’s impending suffering. Comparisons can be drawn with the Bury St. Edmunds Apocalypse and the Hunterian Psalter, where similar pigment palettes and arch framing occur. Overall, this illumination bridges Romanesque monumentality and Gothic expressiveness, serving both didactic and devotional functions within a liturgical context."

      "scene_description": "The two-panel composition depicts a hagiographic martyrdom in precise detail. In the left panel five figures occupy a tiled-floor portico beneath a pointed arch: the haloed saint kneels at lower left, draped in ultramarine cloak over red tunic, hands bound, head tilted upward toward two sword-wielding executioners in brown tunics and hose. Behind them stand a bishop in green cope and mitre, carrying a crozier, and two clerics in red gowns observing. The right panel shows the saint’s decapitated body laid supine on a gold ground at lower right, clothed in the same blue and red habit; two mourners in red and green doublets stand to left, one grasping a wooden staff, the other lifting the saint’s head. A rocky hillside and distant tower appear in soft green and grey beyond. Spatially, the panels are equal in scale, separated by a central column, with overlapping figures suggesting shallow depth. Costumes convey status: the saint’s rich cloth-of-gold brocade and fine blue dye contrast with the simple wool tunics of executioners; the bishop’s ermine-lined cope and jewelled crozier mark ecclesiastical authority."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-panel hagiographic illumination was likely produced in a mid-15th-century Burgundian court atelier, reflecting the region’s emphasis on luxurious devotional manuscripts for lay patrons. The high-quality calf vellum and burnished gold leaf indicate a prestigious commission, while the Gothic textura script and rubrication situate the work within the broader trend of vernacular saint’s lives circulated among the nobility. Artistically, the sequential composition and use of a central arcade demonstrate a sophisticated integration of architectural framing that both unites and divides narrative episodes, a device seen in contemporaneous illuminated breviaries. The bold ultramarine and vermilion pigments, layered with lead-white highlights and outlined in fine quill work, exemplify the technical achievements of Burgundian illuminators, likely influenced by Parisian colour palettes yet distinct in their regional iconographic choices. Iconographically, the scenes underscore the saint’s unwavering faith amid persecution, using hierarchical scaling and haloed figures to convey sanctity. The absence of true linear perspective is offset by overlapping figures and intuitive depth cues, typical of late medieval pictorial conventions. Comparatively, the work shares compositional parallels with the Froissart workshop’s illuminated chronicles, yet innovates through its dual-panel narrative approach, blending traditional hagiographic content with fresh spatial organization to engage the private devotional viewer."

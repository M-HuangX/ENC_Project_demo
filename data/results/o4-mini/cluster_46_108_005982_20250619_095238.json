A bearded bishop in full mitre and blue liturgical vestments stands to one side holding a gold crosier, his cope embroidered with foliate patterns. Behind him, an executioner in brown tunic and hose raises a broad two-handed sword, the blade mid-swing. On the tiled floor a discarded hat and a small altar cloth suggest improvised shrine. The kneeling figure’s garment appears to be rich wool trimmed with fur at the collar, indicating high status; the bishop’s embroidered hems denote ecclesiastical rank. Depth is suggested only by overlapping figures and the receding floor tiles. The executioner’s motion contrasts with the saint’s calm supplication, emphasizing the clash between violence and sanctity."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-panel miniature, embedded within an Old French hagiographic text, reflects a late 14th-century workshop likely operating in northern France. The use of ultramarine—an expensive imported pigment—alongside burnished gold leaf signals a high-status commission, perhaps for a noble patron’s private devotional book. The bilingual layout of red rubrics and black Gothic textura quadrata further indicates courtly tastes. Stylistically, the crisp architectural framing and tiled floors recall Parisian innovations of the 1370s, while the flat modeling and limited spatial recession echo earlier regional traditions. Thematically, the pairing of a devotional presentation scene with a subsequent martyrdom underlines the saint’s sanctity through both piety and passion, reinforcing the cult’s didactic function. Iconographically, the juxtaposition of calm prayer against violent execution dramatizes spiritual steadfastness in the face of persecution, a message well suited to a book of hours intended for meditation on virtue. Comparative analysis suggests affinities with the so-called Bedford Master’s circle, particularly in the handling of drapery folds and facial types. Yet the work diverges in its restrained palette and simplified perspective, indicating either a provincial echo of Parisian models or an economy of production within a smaller workshop. Overall, the miniature bridges traditional iconographic schemes with emerging Gothic architectural motifs, embodying the tension between innovation and convention characteristic of turn-of-the-century illumination."

Eight figures occupy a shallow stage: centrally, Pepin seated on a throne supported by gilt lion heads, wearing a simple mantle and next to receiving a crown. Behind him the Pope, distinguished by a triple tiara and pallium, stands to place the crown, flanked by two clerics in papal hats. To the right, three tonsured clerics gesture reverently toward the central act. All figures wear long ecclesiastical robes in gray-brown tones accented with white highlights. The space is defined by an azure diapered background with red and gold dots, and a gilt rectangular frame set against an orange groundline. Overlapping figures and consistent scale emphasize collective witness to the act. The lion-headed throne, papal insignia and crown function as symbols of divine sanction and royal authority. Border marginalia of vine scrolls with naturalistic leaves reinforce the manuscript’s decorative program."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This illumination of the coronation of King Pepin the Short by Pope Stephen II exemplifies mid-14th-century French courtly illumination, likely produced in a Parisian workshop catering to royal patrons. Its historical context underscores the Papacy’s role in legitimizing Carolingian rule, reflecting a political theology that linked divine sanction to temporal authority. The use of ultramarine and burnished gold leaf, combined with a dense diapered background, demonstrates both the patron’s wealth and the workshop’s technical mastery. The composition’s centralized focus on the crowning act, flanked by symmetrically arranged clerics, reinforces hierarchical importance while subtle overlapping suggests spatial depth without linear perspective. The lion-headed throne supports resonate as a traditional emblem of regal strength, while the papal tiara and crown articulate the interdependence of Church and monarchy.\n\nStylistically, the miniature reveals collaborative production: precise Gothic textura text executed by a specialist scribe, and a distinct painter’s hand responsible for confident underdrawing, layered pigmentation, and punitive gesso ornamentation. Iconographically, it asserts the Church’s authority to anoint secular rulers, a theme echoed in contemporaneous Grandes Chroniques of France. Comparative parallels with workshop practices of the Boucicaut Master suggest shared models for background diapering and marginal vine scrolls. Ultimately, this scene marries traditional Carolingian iconography with innovative decorative techniques, marking a transitional moment in royal historiography and manuscript art."

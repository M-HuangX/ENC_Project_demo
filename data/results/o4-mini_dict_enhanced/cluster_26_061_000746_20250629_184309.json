On the left, six courtiers in long gowns—alternating red and blue—stand on a narrow platform with hands clasped or gesturing toward the combat. They occupy a red diapered field. On the right, two knights on horseback meet lance to lance: the left knight rides a white horse, wearing a grey mail hauberk, blue-tinged chausses, and a black conical helmet; he wields a straight lance and carries a plain shield. His opponent, on a pink-tinted horse, is clad in a red surcoat over mail, a visored helm, and holds a lance with a pennon; his shield bears a simple heraldic device. Behind the joust, on a blue diapered ground, stands a square stone tower with crenellations. Two crowned figures lean from the battlement—one in black and one in red—observing the tilt. The horizontal layout aligns the knights centrally, with the audience and royal observers framing the action. No other narrative episodes are present; the emphasis rests on the single martial encounter."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-14th-century French illumination likely served as an illustration for a chivalric chronicle or tournament roll commissioned by a noble patron. Its production in a Parisian workshop is suggested by the refined Gothic textura script and ultramarine pigment, imported at great expense. The strict color compartmentalization in red and blue, together with diaper patterns and punched dots, reflects the high decorative standards of the period and underscores the ceremonial nature of the joust. The symmetrical composition and absence of naturalistic perspective adhere to established conventions of courtly representation, emphasizing ritual over realism. Technically, the image demonstrates sophisticated layering of pigments and white lead highlights, while underdrawing traces hint at a guided, collaborative atelier practice. Iconographically, the raised dais of spectators and the elevated tower containing crowned figures reinforce feudal hierarchies, linking martial prowess to royal authority. Compared to contemporary manuscripts such as the Grand Livre des Tournois, this folio shares the same tournament iconography but exhibits a more austere framing device. Its function as entertainment is coupled with mnemonic precision—every gesture and costume detail encodes social status, while the heraldic shields mark individual competitors. By combining traditional jousting motifs with a refined Parisian palette, the image exemplifies the interplay between aristocratic display and manuscript innovation in late medieval France."

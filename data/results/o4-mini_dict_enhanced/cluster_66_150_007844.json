The huntsman on the left wears a red tunic, blue chausses and a blue coif, carrying a wooden hunting spear over his shoulder and a string of dead game; the second huntsman in a blue tunic and red chausses gestures forward with his spear and holds a hunting horn at his hip. Three hounds—one white-and-brown pointer, one greyhound-type and one chestnut pack hound—fill the foreground, collars painted red, bodies taut in mid-stride. Above them, two brown leporids spring toward the upper right margin. The ground is painted a uniform yellow field dotted with stylized grass and white-centered red flowers. Trees and shrubs with trefoil leaves form a dense background, framing the action. Figures are scaled larger than animals; depth is suggested by overlapping ground bands and vegetation clusters. Costumes of simple wool tunics belted at the waist, pointed leather shoes and horn accessories indicate 14th-century hunting attire. The composition focuses on the dynamic chase, with diagonal movement uniting all elements."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This miniature exemplifies a 14th-century bestiary scene blending aristocratic hunting culture with didactic animal lore. Executed on fine calf vellum, the work likely originated in a Parisian workshop catering to noble patrons who commissioned illuminated bestiaries both for private study and display. The vivid palette—vermillion, azurite blue and lead-tin yellow—reflects sophisticated pigment procurement, while the gold leaf highlights signal luxury. Stylistically, the fluid outlines and decorative trefoil foliage show affinity with the English Channel School’s naturalism, yet the flat ground scheme and lack of true perspective adhere to established medieval conventions. Iconographically, the chase of hares by well-collared hounds underscores themes of instinct and nobility, common in moralized bestiary texts that draw human virtues from animal behavior. The pairing of two huntsmen—one in red, one in blue—may mirror classical dichotomies of action and counsel. Compared to the Aberdeen Bestiary, this scene is more dynamic and less densely patterned, indicating a localized adaptation of bestiary iconography. The integration of text below the image, rather than in the margins, prioritizes visual impact and suggests collaborative planning between scribe and illuminator. Overall, this leaf demonstrates the coexistence of traditional iconographic programs with workshop innovations in composition and color."

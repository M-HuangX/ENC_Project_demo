He wears a red wool tunic with ochre-yellow stitching and brown hose, and grips a curved sickle in his right hand while gathering purple grapes from a verdigris green vine. The vine’s twisting branch sweeps from the upper left to the lower right of the medallion, directing the viewer’s gaze toward the woven basket placed at the figure’s right foot. The basket is rendered in ochre and brown tones, its weave pattern indicated by fine pen lines. The burnished gold leaf background fills the roundel behind the figure, creating a flat, luminous field that contrasts with the solid color blocking of the garments. Highlights in white accentuate folds in the tunic and the grape clusters. There is no suggestion of architectural or terrestrial depth; the figure, vine, and basket overlap in a shallow pictorial space. The costume details—visible belt, simple shoe stitching—indicate everyday agricultural dress. The framing blue band with white dots contains the action, emphasizing the discrete episode of grape harvesting."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This late 13th- or early 14th-century calendar leaf was likely produced in a secular workshop in northern France—perhaps Paris—where the growing demand for richly illuminated Books of Hours coincided with an increased interest in naturalistic detail and personalized devotional aids. The depiction of the grape harvest and wine pressing in two medallions not only signals the month of September in the agricultural year but also evokes the Eucharistic symbolism of the vine and blood of Christ, subtly linking secular labor to the liturgical calendar. The use of burnished gold leaf backgrounds, ultramarine blue framing, and precise Gothic textura quadrata script reflects the technical prowess of the workshop and the patron’s high status. Comparative analysis with the Bedford Hours and the Très Riches Heures shows a shared vocabulary of calendar labors, yet here the figures are more robust and grounded, suggesting a regional variant that emphasizes corporeal effort. The historiated initial “KL” with white-vine scroll on blue ground demonstrates the integration of decorative and narrative functions, guiding the devotee from the opening of Kalends to the feast days listed in red and black. This page exemplifies the transitional moment in manuscript illumination when Gothic linearity and vibrant pigment layering reached new heights of refinement, balancing traditional iconography with a more animated representation of seasonal work."

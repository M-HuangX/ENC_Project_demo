On a raised gallery to the left, a procession of haloed figures in long tunics and mantles approach the city gate; the leading figure holds a tall staff or banner. Below, two riverboats glide on dark green waters, each with three fishermen wearing pointed caps and tunics; a central net teems with fish. The tower occupies the vertical center, with two tall cylindrical turrets joined by a crenellated wall and passageway at mid-height. The figures in the gallery are nearly life-size against the tower, indicating importance, while the boats and fishermen are scaled smaller. Costuming details include red mantles lined with blue, green tunics, and white hose; masonry shows fine ashlar patterning. Actions: the haloed group advances in orderly rank toward the gate as the fishermen haul a heavy net, suggesting provisioning or symbolic linkage. The water is rendered with stylized waves."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This folio likely originates from a mid-14th-century Parisian workshop, reflecting the height of Gothic manuscript illumination and the city’s dominance in luxury book production. The use of burnished gold leaf against a richly diapered ultramarine background, along with the micro-architectural frame, indicates a high-prestige commission, possibly for a cathedral or noble patron with ecclesiastical ties. The depiction of a fortified \"Babilon\" combines historical narrative with symbolic resonance, hinting at contemporary concerns over urban power and spiritual exile. Stylistically, the rendering of figures with elongated proportions, sharply folded drapery, and schematic wave motifs shows affinity with the so-called \"Court School\" illuminators in Paris, while the vigorous use of pink lake for masonry suggests technical exchanges with English ateliers. The collaborative nature of the work is evident in varying line quality: a master painter likely executed the faces and architectural elements, while assistants filled in secondary tones. Iconographically, the procession of haloed personages toward the city and the fisheries below may allude both to Old Testament deportations and Christological imagery of the Church’s mission, merging typology and contemporary urban symbolism. Comparatively, the border’s gilded vine scroll and punchwork can be linked to the Psalter of Queen Jeanne of Navarre, indicating a shared decorative repertoire that balances tradition with innovative color handling and narrative integration."

In the front row at left, Mary wears a peach-pink cloak with green lining, holds a small red-bound book, and gazes upward; at right, John the Evangelist in blue drapery over a red tunic also holds a book and raises his hand in awe. Centered slightly behind is Saint Peter, identifiable by his short curly beard and holding a yellow-bound volume. Nine other apostles occupy the two overlapping tiers behind, their faces turned upward, hands raised in gesture of reception. The white dove of the Holy Spirit descends from a band of stylized blue and white clouds, encircled by a small nimbus. The floor beneath the bench is green and brown, suggesting grass and stone. Figures are tightly packed, faces individualized by varied curly or wavy hair, and garments display realistic folds with fine hatching. Depth is conveyed by overlapping, the largest figures in front, smaller heads behind. Halos are uniformly burnished gold leaf. The composition focuses attention on the descent of the Spirit, framed by a decorative red and gold diaper pattern background."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This Pentecost miniature reflects the International Gothic style flourishing in late 14th-century Parisian workshops. Executed on fine calf vellum, its precise quill-pen underdrawing and layered pigments reveal a collaborative atelier where specialists applied gesso, gold leaf, and color. The sumptuous use of burnished gold and ultramarine underscores a high-status commission, likely for a noble patron’s Book of Hours intended for private devotion. Iconographically, the descending dove and upward gestures encapsulate the Holy Spirit’s outpouring, while the individualized apostles’ physiognomies reflect a move toward greater emotional realism. The quatrefoil framing and diapered ground demonstrate a continuity with earlier Gothic manuscript traditions, yet the refined modeling and spatial crowding indicate evolving approaches to depth and narrative focus. Comparisons with the Psalter of Jean de Berry suggest shared workshop practices and stylistic motifs, particularly in border punch-work and cloud bands. Technically, the miniature showcases sophisticated material use—raised gesso supports for gold, white lead highlighting, and subtle verdigris accents—that speak to advanced conservation of color. This sheet exemplifies the transition between formal hieratic representation and the more naturalistic tendencies of pre-Renaissance illumination, bridging liturgical function and personal devotional engagement."

At center, the Virgin kneels in deep blue mantle over a green robe, hands clasped before the nude infant lying in a straw-filled manger at her feet. Behind Mary, Saint Joseph stands in contemplative posture, clad in a brown-toned tunic and cloak, holding his staff. To his left, a shepherd with green hood and red tunic leans forward, staff in hand, witnessing the miracle. Above the shelter, God the Father is shown within a semicircular roundel set against a star-studded blue sky, emitting golden rays that descend toward the Christ child, visually linking heaven and earth. An angel kneels at left, raising hands in adoration. The ground is strewn with straw, and the stable’s simple roof and beams frame the encounter. Rich drapery folds, gold highlights, and expressive gestures emphasize the sacred event’s emotional intensity."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This late 15th-century illumination, likely produced in a Parisian workshop, exemplifies the rich devotional culture surrounding personal Books of Hours among the nobility. The elegant Gothic textura script, combined with the lavish use of ultramarine and burnished gold, indicates a luxury commission intended to reflect the patron’s status and piety. The centralized Nativity scene, framed within an architectural stable under a starry celestial band, conveys both intimate human emotion and transcendent divine intervention. God the Father’s upper roundel, linked by golden rays to the infant Christ, manifests a typological unity between Old and New Testament theologies, a common feature in late medieval iconography. Marginal roundels and exuberant acanthus scrolls reveal the influence of the International Gothic style, blending fluid naturalistic ornament with formalized geometric patterns. Technical features such as gesso-raised backgrounds and underdrawing visibility under UV light speak to sophisticated workshop practices and the collaborative efforts of specialist illuminators and gilders. Comparisons with manuscripts like the Hours of Etienne Chevalier highlight shared Parisian stylistic traits—particularly the rhythmic alternation of red and blue border motifs and the integration of devotional donors within marginal cycles. This folio therefore stands at the intersection of tradition and innovation, merging well-established iconographic programs with refined compositional experimentation to serve both spiritual and social functions."

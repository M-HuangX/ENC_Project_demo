To his right sits an attendant in pink-red robes; to his left stands a youth in blue, hands clasped. In the foreground a kneeling deacon in a long blue cloak offers a gold-handled vessel to a standing attendant in red with a brimmed cap. The tiled floor is rendered in green and pink veins, and fluted pillars frame a curtained niche. The right panel depicts the same deacon, now in a blue robe with red cap, bending to add wood to a low brazier set against a stone façade with lancet windows. The ground alternates bands of grass and pale earth with scattered stones, and in the distance a castle mound and rolling hills appear under a pale blue sky."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-panel illumination of a deacon’s martyrdom by fire likely originates from a late fifteenth-century Parisian workshop, reflecting the period’s thriving market for richly decorated Books of Hours. The dichotomy of interior and exterior settings underscores both the deacon’s service before ecclesiastical authorities and his subsequent suffering, a narrative device common in hagiographic cycles. The use of ultramarine blue and burnished gold leaf, combined with layered white highlights, exemplifies the technical sophistication of Île-de-France illuminators, while the flat, overlapping planes and absence of true linear perspective reveal a transitional approach to spatial representation. The patterned canopy and pilaster show micro-architectural influences drawn from contemporary Gothic church design. Iconographically, the vessel and brazier serve as clear martyr-attributes, linking this deacon to the cult of St. Lawrence, though the absence of a gridiron suggests a more generalized martyr narrative. Comparatively, the stylistic affinities with the Hours of Louis of Orléans point to shared workshop practices, such as gesso relief and detailed underdrawing, yet the relatively restrained border treatment hints at a bespoke commission rather than a high-court production. Overall, the miniature balances narrative clarity, devotional function, and visual opulence, embodying the synthesis of personal piety and artistic display characteristic of late medieval Parisian illumination."

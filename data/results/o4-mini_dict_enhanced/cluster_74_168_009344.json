To the right are three smaller object studies: a stylized hill, a rectangular bronze ingot, and a suspended purse or bag, each labeled in red. Figures wear simple garments with minimal modeling; scale is schematic. Spatially they occupy a shallow band, with no background beyond a ruled border. Costume details include knee-length tunics, hose, pointed shoes. The planetary head has a partially stylized beard and large eyes; the nude figure is drawn frontally, arms at sides. The whole serves as an encyclopedic mnemonic of astrological-metallurgical correspondences."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This page exemplifies a thirteenth-century encyclopedic tradition, likely produced in a school or university setting where mnemonic imagery aided the teaching of astronomy, metallurgy and natural history. The compartmentalized layout and restrained palette reflect pedagogical priorities over luxury: clear brown ink outlines, red-ink captions, and sparing green washes maximize legibility. The personification of Saturn holding a nude figure suggests a conceptual link between planets and metals, drawing on classical and Arabic scientific sources. The middle register’s tools and the bottom register’s animal fragments demonstrate a miscellany of technical and natural knowledge, characteristic of early scholastic miscellanies. Stylistically, the fine abrasions and uniform line indicate a professional workshop familiar with educational manuscripts rather than a luxury illuminator working for a noble patron. Compared to contemporary Gothic bestiaries, this compilation is more schematic and utilitarian, lacking decorative borders or gold leaf. Yet its precise line work and clear labeling attest to a sophisticated grasp of didactic visualization. It bridges the monastic manuscript culture with emerging university practices, reflecting the growing thirst for organized knowledge in the later Middle Ages."

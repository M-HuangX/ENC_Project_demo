      "scene_description": "The two-panel miniature occupies a single horizontal register. In the left panel, eight figures cluster closely: six Jewish priests in red and blue cloaks with pointed hats, led by Caiaphas (identified in the text above), lean forward in animated discussion. Their garments show fine white highlights, ochre linings, and patterned hems, with one figure raising a finger in accusation. All stand on a shallow green ground against a white field patterned with gold tendrils. In the right panel, Christ, distinguished by cruciform halo and seated on a cushioned bench, wears a blue tunic under a red mantle; his right hand is raised in blessing. To his left, two attendants in white and blue robes present him; to his right, Pilate in white robes pours water from an ewer over his left hand into a basin held by a servant, symbolizing his washing of innocence. Both scenes share a continuous ground line and are framed by three slender columns supporting round arches under a single red border.\n\nSecondary Elements: Architectural framing unifies the narrative, while the gold background and punch-dot decoration in the right panel highlight Christ’s divinity. The left panel’s vine motif contrasts with the right’s solid gold. Gestural lines and repeated palette guide the viewer from judgment plotting to trial. Text above names Caiaphas, directly linking image and inscription; text below resumes the Gospel narrative, reinforcing the visual sequence as an exegetical aid."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-panel Passion miniature was produced in a high-quality scriptoria, likely in northern France in the early 13th century, during a period when monastic patrons sought richly illuminated Gospel books for liturgical and devotional use. The dual scenes—Caiaphas and the Jewish priests plotting Christ’s condemnation, followed by the trial before Pilate—reflect a theological emphasis on the transition from Jewish council judgment to Roman authority, underscoring both scriptural continuity and Christological doctrine. The stylistic execution, notably the burnished gold ground and refined color palette of ultramarine, vermilion, and verdigris, aligns with the Parisian school’s innovations in layering pigments and integrating luxurious materials. The architectural arcade framing, with its classical round arches, demonstrates a transitional approach that merges Romanesque solidity with emerging Gothic elegance. Underdrawing visible beneath the pigments, combined with punchwork decoration in the gold leaf, highlights the technical sophistication of the workshop. Iconographically, the portrayal of Pilate washing his hands reinforces moral teaching on responsibility and innocence, while the facial types of the priests, rendered with individualized features, suggest an interest in human expression. Comparatively, this illumination shares affinities with the Morgan Picture Bible and the Winchester Bible cycle in its narrative clarity and compositional economy, yet it also introduces novel background treatments that anticipate later Gothic ornamentation. Overall, the miniature exemplifies a confluence of liturgical function, theological messaging, and artistic innovation characteristic of early Gothic manuscript illumination."

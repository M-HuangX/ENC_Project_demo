The right vignette depicts four figures: at center Christ again haloed, standing in the same ochre robe, arms grasped by two temple guards in blue tunics and hose, whose garments share the same pigment tone as the staff-bearer in the first scene; to the far right a figure in teal cloak gestures towards the arrested Christ. All figures align on a single grey ground line, set against a continuous vermilion background. Costumes are rendered with flat color fields, simple rounded folds, and white highlights. The benches and staff serve as minimal props. Facial features are sketchily indicated with two dots and line mouths. Spatial depth is indicated only by overlapping forms, and hierarchical importance is affirmed by the repeated central placement and distinct halo of Christ. The scenes are framed by a thin red rule and occupy the upper third of the page, above a block of twelve lines of Gothic rotunda text."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-panel composition, executed in a high-quality Gothic rotunda hand and vivid palette, likely originates from a mid-13th-century French workshop—perhaps associated with the Parisian circle of the School of Amiens—where vernacular biblical narratives were produced for lay patrons. The uninterrupted red ground and parallel framing devices reflect an economical yet effective visual program, guiding the reader through the trial and arrest of Christ. The use of burnished gold and layered pigments indicates advanced technical proficiency: raised gesso under halos, underdrawing for compositional planning, and careful pigment layering for color stability. Iconographically, the dual scenes underscore the transition from divine judgment to human violence, reinforcing moral lessons on faith and betrayal. The clear delineation of robes—azurite for temple figures, ochre for Christ—and the repetition of halos serve both theological and didactic functions, marking sacred presence within a secularized setting. Compared to contemporary Biblia moralisée, this manuscript offers a more streamlined narrative focus with fewer allegorical medallions, aligning it with smaller-format devotional books of hours produced in elite Parisian ateliers. Its exceptional preservation and technical sophistication reveal a collaborative workshop practice, where multiple hands contributed under a master illuminator, blending traditional iconography with a restrained compositional innovation that emphasizes narrative clarity and devotional intimacy."

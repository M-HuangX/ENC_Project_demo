      "scene_description": "The folio presents two horizontal narrative registers depicting sequential decapitations of kings. In the upper register, a crowned monarch, clad in a red mantle over a green tunic, sits at left with bare feet visible. A youthful executioner in a green tunic stands center, sword raised high, preparing to strike a reclining victim draped in red on the right. Three severed heads, rendered in outline with vermilion blood-strokes, float above and beside the body. The lower register repeats the composition with variations: the king now wears a green robe, the executioner is garbed in yellow, and two severed heads lie at right. Both scenes are contained within plain ruled borders. Spatially, figures occupy a single plane, with no attempt at depth; scale remains constant to emphasize narrative clarity. Costume details—circlets with small pearls, simple kinnor-style tunics, and bare feet for royalty—denote status. The executioners’ tunics lack ornament, marking their common status. The drapery is indicated by parallel ink lines but lacks modeling. Secondary elements include the identical framing device and repeated palette, which integrate the registers into a cohesive story cycle. Although text appears above and below as captions, the images stand alone to illustrate the historical episodes. Direct textual references are minimal, indicating the manuscript was used as a visual chronicle of violent royal justice."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-register folio likely originates from a mid-13th-century historical chronicle produced in a university town workshop, possibly in northern France. The crisp Gothic textualis and professional execution suggest a commission for scholarly use, emphasizing the violent fates of rulers as moral exempla. The restrained palette of vermilion and verdigris, applied flatly, reflects economy in materials consistent with educational manuscripts rather than deluxe luxury books. The repetition of compositional tropes—the king seated on the left, executioner centrally poised, and victim reclining on the right—underscores a didactic clarity, guiding the reader through a visual narrative of royal justice. Iconographically, the crowns and circlets identify the victims as sovereigns, while the executioners’ plain tunics mark their commoner status, reinforcing social hierarchy. The absence of architectural settings or natural backgrounds focuses attention on the act of decapitation itself, signaling a moral lesson on the perils of power. In comparative perspective, the folio shares affinities with University of Paris manuscripts of historical texts, both in its austere palette and narrative directness. The skilful line work and surviving underdrawings attest to a trained illuminator working from a well-defined iconographic model. This page thereby exemplifies the intersection of educational purpose and visual storytelling in the Gothic historical tradition."

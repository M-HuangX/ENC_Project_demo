At center right, a pilgrim wearing a patterned tunic and red hose holds a long staff topped with a small crossbeam. Four companions, clad in plain tunics and chaperons of red and brown, cluster to his left, two gesturing towards him. All wear pointed poulaines and belted garments; the pilgrim’s tunic displays a wavy pattern in red on a light ground. Two stylized trees with red-dotted foliage rise behind the group at left margin. The right page contains a schematic map: an ochre-green field bordered by tufts of red vegetation and small house-shaped buildings. No architectural framing is used in the main scene; the map’s organic border echoes the trees on the figure page. The Latin caption above directly refers to the pilgrimage episode, integrating text and image by thematic correspondence."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-15th-century manuscript leaf appears to originate from a regional workshop producing illustrated travel narratives or pilgrimage guides. The pairing of a full-page figural scene with a schematic map reflects a didactic impulse: the image of the crowned pilgrim and his companions visually anchors the text at the head of the page, while the right-hand map-like diagram reinforces spatial orientation. The bold black outlines and flat color washes, limited to vermillion and olive green, adhere to a pragmatic aesthetic typical of provincial scriptoria rather than the polychromy of major urban centers. The Gothic cursive hand suggests rapid documentary copying—likely for use by clerics or educated lay travelers. Iconographically, the cross-tipped staff identifies the central figure as a pilgrim, while the companions signal communal devotion. The stylized trees and tufts connect the narrative and cartographic spaces, creating visual cohesion across the spread. Comparatively, this layout recalls English Channel School manuscripts in its combination of travelogue and map, though the restrained palette and documentary script align more closely with Germanic or Italian itineraries. The synthesis of image, text, and map anticipates later devotional atlases and illustrates the broader medieval interest in integrating narrative and geographic knowledge."

His right hand rests on his knee while his gaze directs attention to two victims at right, clad in green robes with minimal drapery lines. Between them stands a youthful executioner in an orange-brown tunic, holding a high, unsheathed sword poised over the bound victims. Both victims are already beheaded: their severed heads, with stylized curly hair and anguished expressions, hover beside their bodies, connected by dripping red strokes. The composition uses flat ground and no shading, relying on clean outlines and uniform pigment application. Spatially, the seated king is largest, emphasizing authority, while the executioner and victims recede in scale. The empty white background and simple ink border focus attention on the action. Decorative elements are limited to the ink frame and ruled divider, underscoring the didactic purpose. The pictorial focus lies on the moment of decapitation, reinforced by the repetition of red blood strokes and the victims’ identical costume and posture."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-register depiction of martyrdom was likely produced in a 13th-century monastic workshop as part of a Latin martyrology or legendaries. The crisp Gothic textura script and professional execution of quill-lined figures point to a trained scribe–illuminator team, reflecting the rising demand for illustrated hagiographical texts in monastic libraries. The stylistic use of flat color washes and minimal shading aligns with transitional Parisian illumination around 1250, emphasizing clarity over naturalism. Iconographically, the repetition of the king and executioner across registers underscores the inexorable authority of secular power over Christian martyrs, while the vivid red blood connects both scenes in a continuous narrative of suffering. The simple architectural arch in the lower register introduces a micro-architectural device, foreshadowing later Gothic niche frames. Compared to contemporary manuscripts such as the Golden Legend compilations, this miniature is notable for its restrained palette and absence of gold leaf, suggesting either a deliberate ascetic aesthetic or localized resource constraints. The scenes reinforce monastic ideals of steadfast faith under persecution, serving both as devotional exempla and pedagogical tools in preaching contexts. Its compositional economy and linear clarity anticipate later workshop practices that favored reproducible narrative formulas, linking this manuscript to broader trends in 13th-century hagiographic illumination."

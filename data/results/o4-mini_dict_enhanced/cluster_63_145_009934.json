      "scene_description": "Upper register: Four figures occupy a flat ground line. At left, a seated crowned judge wears an ochre cloak over a green-lined tunic, his right hand resting on his knee. Centered, an executioner in a knee-length ochre tunic and hose holds aloft a long sword wrapped in cloth. To the right, a kneeling martyr in a green robe places both hands on his thighs; his head is tilted back awaiting the stroke. The king’s enlarged scale and frontal posture establish his authority. There is no architectural setting, only a simple frame. Garments are rendered with minimal folds and no shading. The martyr’s robes are outlined in brown ink and filled with flat green wash. The executioner’s upraised sword is the visual focus, reinforced by the diagonal of his arms.   Secondary elements: The two registers function as marginal scenes to each other, linked by the frame and repeated motifs. The identical seated judge provides compositional integration, while the executioner’s mirrored posture creates a clear temporal progression. The green and ochre palette unifies both scenes. Scene transitions are signaled by the continuous frame and ground line, guiding the viewer downward to the second martyrdom.   Visual-Textual Relationships: The Latin captions above and below explicitly name the martyrs and describe their decapitation, directly glossed by the images. The images do not intrude into the text; rather, text and image occupy separate zones with captions serving as labels. The frame emphasizes the pictorial sequence as a distinct narrative unit. No rubrics intervene, and the text remains primary for naming while the images visualize the suffering."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-register martyrdom illustration likely dates to the mid‐13th century, produced in a northern French workshop where the Gothic textualis and linear pen-drawing style were prevalent. The repetition of the seated judge and central executioner across registers reflects a workshop practice of reusing compositional templates to illustrate different episodes in a saint’s Passion. The limited palette—verdigris green for martyrs’ robes, ochre for the judge’s cloak, and minium red for blood and crown details—illustrates an economical approach to color that nonetheless conveys symbolic meaning: green for life in martyrdom, red for sacrificial blood, and ochre for worldly authority. The absence of architectural setting focuses attention on the figures and their actions, aligning with the growing emphasis on affective devotion in the mid-1200s. Iconographically, the decapitation motif underscores the saints’ triumph over earthly power, while the crown and judge’s calm posture reinforce the tension between secular authority and divine witness. Comparative examples in manuscripts such as the Book of the City of Ladies (Paris, ca. 1375) show a similar use of compartmentalized narrative registers and repetitive figure types, though here the earlier execution of flat washes points to a transitional stage before the richer polychromy of later Gothic illumination. This folio thus bridges Carolingian-derived linear traditions and the emerging Gothic interest in emotional narrative, serving both as a didactic tool and a devotional stimulus for its original owner."

At center Christ’s slender, lifeless body (pale flesh tones, white lead highlights) is being lowered by Joseph of Arimathea (yellow robe, white beard) and Nicodemus (red cloak) from a rugged wooden cross. A ladder rests at right; Nicodemus supports Christ’s torso while Joseph steadies his legs. Below, the Virgin Mary (blue mantle over red gown) swoons, supported at left by Saint John the Evangelist (red cloak over green tunic). To the right kneels Mary Magdalene (green tunic, maroon skirt), hands raised in grief. Two angels hover at upper left and right, one holding a chalice to catch Christ’s blood, the other raising hands in lament. The ground is rendered as grassy turf with stylized hills in the distance. Each figure overlaps the next, creating depth. Costume details include gold-trimmed hems, carefully modeled drapery folds, and individual facial expressions of sorrow. The central vertical axis of the cross organizes the composition, while diagonal gestures lead the eye from the ladder to the grieving group."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This illumination, likely produced in a Paris workshop ca. 1410–1420, exemplifies the International Gothic style’s elegant linearity and sumptuous color. The strong ultramarine sky, lavish gold leaf and refined vine border reflect the high-quality materials commissioned by a noble patron. The scene’s devotional focus on the deposition caters to private meditation on Christ’s Passion, a popular theme in early 15th-century Books of Hours. The fluid quill work and underdrawing indicate a two-handed production: a master for figures and a journeyman for border ornament. Its iconography—swooning Mary, supportive John, and angels collecting Christ’s blood—underscores the theological emphasis on Christ’s sacrificial humanity and the Virgin’s compassion. Comparisons with the Hours of Jeanne d’Evreux reveal similar border grotesques and cherubic heads, while the emotional restraint aligns with Flemish influences reaching Paris. This leaf bridges French elegance and emerging Netherlandish naturalism: overlapping figures create spatial depth without strict perspective, and detailed facial expressions intimate individual grief. The piece thus stands at a stylistic crossroads, merging established devotional iconography with nascent observational detail, reflecting both tradition and innovation within early 15th-century manuscript illumination."

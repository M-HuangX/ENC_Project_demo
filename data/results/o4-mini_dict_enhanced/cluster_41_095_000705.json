      "scene_description": "In the Dormition scene (left), the Virgin reclines on a richly draped bier raised on low supports. Two angels hover above her head, one scattering flowers, the other holding a nun’s veil. At her feet two small female mourners gesture toward her still form. The drapery is rendered with layered folds and white highlights, indicating a cloth-of-gold pattern originally. The bier is covered by a curtained canopy held by slender columns. The Virgin’s face is serene, outlined with a fine pen stroke and a gilded halo. Behind the bed, a priestly figure in a cope intones from an open liturgical book, his tall mitre and crozier marking his rank. The spatial arrangement is shallow but clearly structured: foreground figures overlap the bier, midground angels occupy the upper register, and background is defined by a stylized tree canopy. The composition emphasizes the transition from earthly death to heavenly reception, with visual weight centered on the Virgin’s head and the angelic activity above."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This illumination, likely produced in a Parisian workshop in the mid–14th century, reflects the heightened Marian devotion characteristic of the Avignon papacy period. The threefold sequence of the Dormition, the apostolic liturgy, and the Coronation of the Virgin situates the Virgin Mary within both theological and liturgical traditions, underscoring her role as intercessor and Queen of Heaven. The sophisticated use of gold leaf, layered pigment application, and fine penwork aligns with known practices of the English Channel School, suggesting cross-Channel influences in the rendering of drapery and figure modeling. The consistent halo design and mandorla framing evoke Byzantine precedents while the naturalistic tree canopy and drapery highlights point to innovations in Gothic illumination. Technically, the raised gesso underlayer and precise ruling indicate a high-end commission, likely by a noble patron seeking both devotional efficacy and a display of wealth. Iconographically, the presence of a bishop and apostles bridges ecclesiastical authority with Marian theology, while the final coronation scene visually asserts the doctrine of Mary’s queenship. Comparatively, this leaf shares affinities with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile in its hierarchical composition and decorative restraint, yet diverges in narrative complexity. Overall, the miniature exemplifies a synthesis of tradition and innovation, serving private devotion and reinforcing social status through its luxurious execution and rich iconographic program."

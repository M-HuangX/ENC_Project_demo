      "scene_description": "Within a temple-like niche sits a winged angel, haloed in burnished gold, atop the rolled-away green tomb slab. Clad in white and pale yellow-washed drapery, he gestures with his right hand and holds a slender staff in his left. To the left stand two haloed women—Mary Magdalene and Mary of Clopas—dressed in blue and rose tunics with white veils, each bearing an ointment jar. At their feet lie two discarded burial cloths. To the right, two Roman soldiers recline against the niche wall, clad in blue tunics under red mantles, gripping shields and spears. The architectural frame consists of red-tiled pitched roof, blue entablature, ochre stepped upper storey and flanking arcades. Figures form a balanced triangular composition; the angel’s raised gesture directs the viewer’s gaze to the two women. Costumes are detailed with gold trims; the jars are cinnabar-toned with gold highlights. The empty tomb slab, angled toward the viewer, accents the miraculous setting. The flat olive background isolates the episode, emphasizing its sacred dimension."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This illuminated scene of the Resurrection—characterized by its temple-niche architecture, flat olive background, and stylized drapery—likely emerges from an Ottonian or early Romanesque workshop influenced by classical antiquity. The use of burnished gold halos and the elevated seated angel reflect imperial iconography, situating the divine messenger within a timeless, sacred space. The crisp, fluid outlines and minimal shading are consistent with a skilled monastic atelier that valued clarity of line and spiritual abstraction over naturalism. The architectural frame recalls imperial ceremonial architecture, reinforcing the idea of Christ’s victory as both sacred and sovereign. The juxtaposition of the two female witnesses in vivid ultramarine and the slumbering soldiers in red and blue mantles conveys theological contrast—faithful recognition versus oblivious authority. As a devotional image in a private book, it serves both as mnemonic for the central Christian miracle and as a demonstration of the patron’s erudition and piety. Comparatively, its compositional clarity and restrained palette parallel the Liuthar Gospels fragments, indicating cross-Alpine exchange in manuscript art. Innovatively, the angled tomb slab and the dynamic gesture of the angel suggest a nascent interest in spatial interaction, foreshadowing later Romanesque narrative dynamism while retaining Ottonian austerity."

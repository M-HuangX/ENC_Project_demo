His slender figure is outlined in uniform brown-black ink, and his face is rendered with fine pen strokes emphasizing a long beard and serene expression. To his right stands a barefoot, curly-haired saint in a green tunic, hands outstretched to receive divine counsel; the saint’s garment falls in rhythmic folds highlighted by white accents. Both figures rest on a straight ground line within a plain rectangular frame. In the lower register, two disciples, each in green and tan robes, carefully carry the shrouded corpse of the saint on a wooden bier. The corpse’s head bears a gold halo and is tilted slightly forward. The red shroud, rendered in minium, drapes over the bier with parallel fold lines. Figures in both scenes share the same scale, ink outline, and sparse spatial setting, allowing the narrative to progress clearly from heavenly blessing to earthly burial. Text captions above and below the frame directly reference the episodes, integrating image and text in a cohesive devotional program."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-13th-century hagiographic miniature likely originated in a continental workshop influenced by the emerging Gothic linear style, characterized by fluid pen lines and restrained color washes. The two-register composition, dividing heavenly blessing and earthly burial, underscores the soteriological journey of the saint. The use of ultramarine and shell gold signals the manuscript’s high quality and perhaps the patron’s wealth, while the verdigris and minium provide economical yet effective secondary hues. The thin washes, visible underdrawing, and raised gesso halos attest to a collaborative production involving a delineator and colorist, reflecting standard scriptorial division of labor. Iconographically, the scene aligns with late medieval emphasis on the saint’s corporeal intercession, as Christ’s blessing directly precedes the saint’s death, inviting the reader to contemplate the promise of resurrection. Comparatively, the restrained naturalism and framing devices recall Parisian manuscripts of the same period, though the linear austerity suggests influence from English exemplars such as the Winchester School. This synthesis of French and Anglo-Norman elements points to a cross-Channel artistic exchange. The manuscript’s format and Latin text indicate its use in personal devotion or as a memory aid for sermons, bridging private reflection and clerical instruction in the devotional culture of the 13th century."

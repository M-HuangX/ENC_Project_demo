      "scene_description": "A single apocalyptic scene occupies the miniature. On the left, the Beast from the Sea is seated on a rocky outcrop; its spotted, leopard-like body supports ten slender horns tipped with gold discs. It holds a long, fleur-de-lis-tipped scepter in its right hand. Centered is the seven-headed red dragon: each head bears a golden disc at the crown, bat-like wings folded at its sides, and a long sinuous tail curving back underfoot. To the right kneels a crowned king in a blue tunic and purple cloak, hands clasped in prayer, head turned toward the dragon. Behind him stand five attendants in varied tunics and hoods, gesturing and gazing toward the beast. All figures rest on a single ground line against an unpainted parchment background. Costume details include the king’s circlet and gold-trimmed mantle, while attendants wear pointed poulaines and hooded cloaks. Spatial hierarchy is clear: the oversized beasts loom over the diminutive humans. The border’s gold and colored bands frame the action, reinforcing the central focus on the confrontation between monstrous evil and human worship. Text below references the Revelation narrative, linking the image directly to the scriptural account."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This illuminated miniature likely belongs to a French or Anglo-French Apocalypse manuscript produced in a court workshop around 1320–1340. Its high-quality calf vellum, rich ultramarine and gold leaf, and professional Gothic textura script suggest an aristocratic commission intended for private reflection on the Last Things. The iconography follows Revelation 13 closely: the sea beast crowned with ten horns and the seven-headed red dragon emphasize the threat of idolatry and divine justice. Stylistically, the balanced but hierarchical composition, flat color fields, and punchwork decoration align with contemporary Parisian illumination, while the minimal spatial depth reflects inherited Romanesque conventions. The work demonstrates technical sophistication in layered pigment application and gesso-raised gold, pointing to an experienced atelier employing multiple specialists. Iconographically, the scene warns the viewer against false worship, resonating with early fourteenth-century concerns about heresy and royal authority. Comparatively, the miniatures recall the Apocalypse of St. John from the British Library’s Royal Ms. 19 C vi, though here the border alternates red and blue panels instead of continuous foliate scrolls. The presentation of crowned figures alongside monstrous beasts serves both devotional and political functions, subtly equating earthly rulers with the apocalyptic beast and cautioning noble viewers. Overall, the page exemplifies the fusion of artistic innovation and traditional iconography characteristic of high medieval Apocalypse manuscripts."

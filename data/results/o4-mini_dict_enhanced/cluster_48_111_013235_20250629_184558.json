The angel’s right hand is raised in blessing; his left holds a white scroll inscribed in black ink. The women, each with nimbus, incline forward in astonishment. The sarcophagus lid lies to the right, showing chiselled stone texture. Behind them a scalloped archivolt painted in green and edged with gilt bezants frames the scene; a blue border encloses it. The women’s garments feature layered vermilion with white highlights; their halos are simple gold circles. The ground is a stippled green field; the sky is absent, reinforcing the timeless sacred moment. Spatially, figures overlap to suggest depth: the angel’s bench extends before the tomb, and the women stand slightly behind. The angel’s tunic shows stylized pleats with white lead highlights on folds; faces exhibit contouring via careful shading. This panel’s composition places the angel centrally, flanked by symmetrical onlookers, directing attention to the open tomb and the miracle of resurrection."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This illumination likely originates from a late 12th-century French workshop engaged in producing typological picture Bibles, reflecting the era’s pedagogical emphasis on Old Testament prefigurations of Christ’s redemptive work. The cross-shaped grid unites eight Old Testament hero episodes—Samson’s feats, prophetic visions, and David’s triumph—with the central Resurrection scene, visually dramatizing the fulfillment of ancient types in the New Testament. The use of burnished gold backgrounds and ultramarine frames situates these episodes within a transcendent space, while the consistent application of only five pigments demonstrates a sophisticated, unified palette typical of the Parisian masters associated with the Winchester Bible and Morgan Picture Bible traditions. Stylistic features such as delicate underdrawing, gesso-raised gold leaf, and punchwork bezants indicate high technical achievement and participation in the evolving Gothic decorative vocabulary. Iconographically, the pairing of Samson and David with Isaiah and Jeremiah creates a theological program linking divine strength and prophetic anticipation to Christ’s victory over death, tailored to an audience versed in both typology and courtly erudition. Comparative analysis suggests close affinities with the Morgan Genesis windows and the Bibliothèque nationale de France, ms. lat. 10525, indicating a cross-channel transmission of stylistic innovations. This page exemplifies the dynamic interplay of tradition and invention that characterizes the high medieval picture Bible genre."

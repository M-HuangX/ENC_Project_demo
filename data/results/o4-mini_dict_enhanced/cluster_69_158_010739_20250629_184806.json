He stands centrally on a green ground line within a deep ultramarine roundel. He wears a gold crown and halo, chainmail hauberk under a red surcoat edged in gold, and gold chausses. His right hand holds a long gilt sceptre topped with a fleur-de-lys motif; his left holds a globus cruciger. A short sword hilt peeks at his left hip. The roundel rim is lined in white penwork and rests on the letter’s curved stroke; the king’s right foot slightly overlaps the frame. The frontal, hieratic posture emphasizes authority. The figure’s garments are rendered with linear mail detailing and minimal shading. Below the roundel, the black-textura lines of the psalm text continue, the first six lines indented to frame the initial. The border extensions of the letter feature scrolling acanthus leaves and interlace in red, green, blue, and gold, linking image to text as a visual marker for the beginning of the Psalms."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This historiated initial depicting King David inaugurates the Psalms in a high-quality Gothic Psalter, likely produced in a northern French workshop c. 1250–1270. The use of sumptuous ultramarine and burnished gold leaf signals both the economic resources of the patron and the theological importance of David as the psalmist–king. The execution in Gothic textura quadrata, with its disciplined verticality and precise pen flourishes, reflects the professional scriptoria practices of the period. The iconography—crown, halo, sceptre and globus cruciger—fuses royal and divine attributes, prefiguring Christ’s kingship and underscoring the typological link between Old and New Testament. Decorative elements, such as the acanthus scrolls and punched gold diaper surrounding the roundel, bear witness to the influence of Parisian illumination and the English Channel school’s penchant for intricate border work. Technically, the raised gesso underlayer and white highlighting demonstrate advanced material knowledge and refined brushwork characteristic of leading mid-13th-century ateliers. Compared with contemporary Psalters—such as the Psalter of Blanche of Castile—this leaf shares a bold color palette and formal restraint, yet innovates in its integration of royal regalia into a biblical figure. Overall, the page exemplifies the intersection of personal devotion, monastic liturgy, and dynastic self-representation in Gothic manuscript culture."

Christ stands at right, wearing a gold tunic under a vermillion mantle, haloed with burnished gold. He holds Peter’s right ankle in his left hand while gesturing with his right. Peter is shown in a brown ochre hooded tunic, bent forward in humble posture, bare-footed. Behind Christ, five apostles stand in a curved register: they wear alternating blue, green and white tunics, each with individualized facial hair and gestures of deference. Two scrolls emerge: one from Christ’s hand inscribed “diligite invicem,” and one from an apostle. The ground is rendered as rolling green hills sprinkled with stylized red and white flowers; above, a deep azurite sky is dotted with white stars. Spatially, the scene is organized around a diagonal from Peter’s kneeling figure to Christ’s face, reinforced by overlapping figures. Costume details include gold-hemmed drapery, painted linear tooling, and white highlights. The intimate action is framed by a simple red border, emphasizing the central act of service."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This miniature likely originates from a mid-13th-century Northern French Gospel book, produced in a cathedral workshop. Its emphasis on Christ’s humility through foot washing reflects the liturgical focus on servitude exemplified during Maundy Thursday rites. The use of burnished gold leaf, azurite blue and vermillion red denotes high‐status patronage, while the refined Gothic textura quadrata script and rubrication indicate professional scribal intervention. The composition, centralized on Christ and Peter with overlapping apostles, demonstrates a controlled spatial innovation within the constraints of hierarchical scaling rather than true perspective. Linear white tooling and parallel hatching reveal technical advancement in pigment layering. Iconographically, the foot washing underscores the theological primacy of charity and sacral service, resonating with contemporary sermons on Christ’s example. Comparatively, the star-dotted azure background and stylized floral ground connect this work to illuminated Gospel fragments from the Parisian school, yet the individualized facial types hint at a localized atelier influence, possibly linked to the circle of the Saint-Victor scriptorium. The miniature balances tradition—through its formal border and hierarchy—with novel compositional diagonals, marking a transitional moment in Gothic illumination where spatial dynamism and devotional intimacy converge."

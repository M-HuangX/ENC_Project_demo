To the right, a prophet—likely Ezekiel—stands on a platform before a stylized tree, pointing toward a scroll that unfurls across the composition. Beneath Christ, a band of angels carries the scroll and gestures toward two groups: on the left, the saved ascend toward a church building set on stylized hills; on the right, demons wield hooked staffs to drag the damned into flames and a cavernous pit. Eleven saved figures cluster behind a female angel, all robed in blue and white with gold halos; on the right, four demons with bat‐like wings and clawed feet torment half‐naked souls wearing red loincloths. Architectural elements include twin churches with tiled roofs flanking the hills, while a lone tree marks the desolate middle ground. The scroll’s diagonal sweep divides the composition, reinforcing the moral bifurcation. Every figure is outlined in brown ink, with richly painted garments layered over gold leaf. The spatial arrangement emphasizes hierarchical scale—divine figures oversized, human and demonic figures smaller—and overlapping to suggest depth. The scene’s visual weight centers on the prophet’s gesture and the dividing scroll."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This finely illuminated psalter page likely originated in a high‐status workshop in northern France during the third quarter of the 13th century, a period marked by the flourishing of private devotional books for aristocratic patrons. The lavish use of burnished gold leaf, ultramarine pigment reserved for sacred figures, and intricate penwork initials reflects both the wealth of the commissioner and the technical prowess of the atelier. Stylistically, the composition exhibits hallmarks of the Parisian school: bold hieratic scale, fluid drapery folds with white highlights, and architectural micro‐frames echoing contemporary Gothic architecture. The iconography of the Last Judgment—Christ enthroned in a medallion, a prophet gesturing to a bifurcated host, angels and demons enacting salvation and damnation—aligns with liturgical preaching themes prevalent in monastic circles. The depiction of two churches at either end of the hills may subtly reference the Church militant and triumphant, reinforcing ecclesiastical authority. Comparative analysis shows affinities with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile (BnF Latin 115), particularly in the treatment of angelic figures and marginal vine scrolls. Yet, this page innovates by integrating a single expansive band scene rather than isolated miniatures, creating a panoramic theological tableau. The result is a manuscript page that synthesizes tradition and inventive compositional unity, serving both devotional function and dynastic display."

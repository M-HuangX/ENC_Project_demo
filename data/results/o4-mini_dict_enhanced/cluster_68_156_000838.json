In the upper medallion, Christ sits enthroned within a golden mandorla on a cushioned bench, his right hand raised in blessing and left drapery held in his hand. He wears a dark ultramarine cloak lined with red and a white undergarment visible at his chest and feet. Two angels flank him: the left holds a green cross, the right supports the spear bearing the crown of thorns. Their wings are rendered in white with blue and brown shading, and their garments alternate blue and red with white highlights. The lower medallion contrasts salvation and damnation. On the left, an angel bearing a crozier ushers a bishop in mitre, a nobleman in green tunic, a monk in habit, and a laywoman toward an implied heavenly portal. On the right, a horn-blowing demon drags by a silver chain three clerics and three lay figures, their expressions of anguish. The figures stand on a stylized ground line, framed by the same red border and white vine ornament. The hierarchical composition unites divine judgment above with its earthly consequences below. No captions or inscriptions accompany the imagery; instead, the clear emblematic forms convey the Last Judgment narrative through visual contrast, harmonious framing, and a coherent palette."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This richly illuminated folio likely originates from a mid-13th-century French workshop, produced for a wealthy lay patron’s book of hours or devotional psalter. Its hierarchical two-tier composition, with Christ in Majesty above and the fate of souls below, reflects the period’s theological emphasis on divine judgment and the didactic function of devotional imagery. The sophisticated use of burnished gold leaf, genuine ultramarine, and precise underdrawing points to a high-end Parisian atelier under the influence of the ‘English Channel School,’ where Anglo-Norman stylistic traits circulated. The border’s white vine-scroll ornament on a red ground, combined with blue and white framing bands, demonstrates the era’s decorative conventions and the technical mastery of gesso-based raised work. Iconographically, the juxtaposition of elect and damned, bound by chain or guided by the crozier, underscores contemporary moral teachings on salvation and the church’s salvific role—visually reinforcing ecclesiastical authority. Comparisons with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile reveal shared motifs, such as the mandorla and paired angels, yet here the dramatic demon figure exhibits a more grotesque vitality. This folio thus embodies both the tradition of authoritative Last Judgment imagery and the innovative workshop practices of mid-13th-century France, combining theological rigor with courtly artistic sophistication."

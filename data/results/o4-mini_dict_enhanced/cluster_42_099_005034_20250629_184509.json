      "scene_description": "The miniature group comprises two narrative scenes illustrating the Queen of Sheba’s embassy to Solomon. In the left panel (seven figures), a crowned female meanwhile unseen is represented only by her envoys: eight white-robed courtiers and a donkey bearing gifts stand before a vermilion field. The group gestures toward a circular mandorla above, containing a seated bearded figure—God the Father or Solomon in divine wisdom—handing a scroll to an attendant. Figures wear long tunics with simple hems and narrow belts; their gestures and gazes are directed horizontally toward the next panel. In the right panel, the Queen herself, crowned and haloed, rides a laden donkey across a deep ultramarine ground. She holds a tall ewer as a gift. Opposite her stand Solomon and two armored retainers beneath a stylized city façade. Solomon wears a crown and long mantle edged in gold, bearing a scepter; his soldiers carry lances and shields striped black and white. Spatially, the donkey overlaps the margin of Solomon’s niche to suggest continuity. The two scenes are unified by identical framing, matching scroll labels, and reciprocal directional gazes, creating a coherent left-to-right visual narrative."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This bifoliate illumination, likely produced in a Franco-Flemish workshop circa 1330–1350, reveals the synthesis of High Gothic pictorial conventions with didactic biblical narrative. The choice of ultramarine and vermilion grounds, paired with lavish gold leaf on regalia, underscores the dual themes of divine wisdom and royal authority. The symmetrical arrangement of two contiguous miniatures, framed identically and interlinked by directional gazes and matching scroll banners, exemplifies a controlled compositional balance characteristic of Parisian ateliers influenced by the so-called “Rayonnant” aesthetic. The script—a professional Gothic textura quadrata with red and blue rubrication—suggests a commissioned work for an educated audience, perhaps a monastery or university, intended to reinforce moral teachings through memorable visual exempla. Iconographically, the depiction of the Queen of Sheba’s embassy to Solomon draws on typological tradition, aligning her offerings and testimony with the receipt of divine wisdom, thereby echoing contemporary theological exegesis on prophecy and royal virtue. Comparatively, the fine underdrawing and gesso-raised gold link this manuscript to the Psalter of Queen Jeanne of Navarre (Bibliothèque nationale de France, ms. lat. 115), while the clear line and color separations anticipate innovations in Netherlandish illumination. Overall, the page offers a compelling testimony to collaborative workshop practices and to the continued evolution of narrative clarity and ornamental richness in mid-14th-century book arts."

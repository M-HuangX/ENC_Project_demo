Christ, slightly larger than the surrounding figures, sits frontally on a Gothic throne under a blue cloak and rose-colored tunic, holding an open book in his left hand and raising his right in blessing. His halo and the mandorla are burnished gold flecked with red and white punches. At the four cardinal points just outside the mandorla are the four evangelist symbols: the winged man (Matthew) at upper left, the eagle (John) at upper right, the lion (Mark) at lower left, and the ox (Luke) at lower right, each bearing a scroll with its Latin name. In the four surrounding rectangular compartments—two above and two below—are twenty-four elders in white robes and dark girdles, each group of six standing in adoration, facing inward and holding scrolls inscribed with hymnic lines. The background of these panels is vermillion red. The entire composition is contained within a bold blue and white interlace border."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "Produced in a high-end northern French workshop c. 1250–60, this miniature exemplifies the mature Gothic style in its refined line work, sumptuous pigment palette, and precise gilding techniques. The choice of the Maiestas Domini with the twenty-four elders and evangelist symbols reflects a theological program drawn from Revelation 4–5, intended for clerical readers engaged in scriptural exegesis. Technically, the use of raised gesso to heighten the mandorla’s gold leaf and the application of high-quality ultramarine underscore the manuscript’s costly patronage, likely a monastic ecclesiastical house seeking to assert both spiritual and intellectual authority. The symmetrical, compartmentalized composition and consistent decorative vocabulary align with contemporaneous psalters and Apocalypses from Paris, while the crisp underdrawing and disciplined quill work suggest a single master painter with an assistant. Iconographically, the integration of the evangelist symbols on scrolls names reinforces the universal witness to Christ’s sovereignty, and the elders’ hymnic scrolls link image and liturgy. Comparisons to the Psalter of Blanche of Castile reveal shared border patterns and color schemes, whereas the emphasis on educational function differentiates it from purely devotional Books of Hours. This page thus bridges traditional iconographic schemes with the evolving pedagogical demands of mid-13th-century monastic culture."

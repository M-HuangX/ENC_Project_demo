The columns support a series of three small semicircular arches, above which rises a large archivolt painted in burnished gold. Within the blue background of the archivolt are three evangelist symbols: on the left, a haloed winged man (Matthew) holds a banner; in the center, a crowned lion (Mark) grips a scroll inscribed “SECUNDUM”; on the right, a winged ox (Luke) with a nimbus clutches its own scroll. Beneath the arcade, the text is arranged in four narrow Latin columns listing gospel parallel passages in small Carolingian‐minuscule script. Wide parchment margins enclose the composition, filled with a continuous border of scrolling acanthus leaves and small buds, punctuated in the upper corners by facing peacocks with trailing tail plumage. The overall spatial organization is flat and frontal, emphasizing the sacred function of the arcade as a metaphorical gateway to the Gospels."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "Produced in a high‐status Western European workshop—likely northern Italy or southern France—during the late 11th to early 12th century, this canon‐table page exemplifies the continued Carolingian tradition of Eusebian apparatus enlivened by Romanesque decorative exuberance. The combination of burnished gold leaf and rich ultramarine signals substantial patronal investment and reflects the growing trend toward visual splendor in liturgical books of the period. The symmetrical arcade and acanthus‐leaf border indicate continuity with classical architectural motifs, while the stylized peacocks underscore early medieval associations of the bird with immortality and the Resurrection. Technically, the use of raised gesso supports the gilding, and the confidence of the Carolingian minuscule script—complete with uniform ruling—points to a professional scriptorium under episcopal or monastic patronage. Iconographically, the placement of the evangelist symbols within the archivolt transforms the canonical table into a sacred portal, aligning the textual function of cross‐referencing Gospel passages with the devotional act of divine contemplation. Comparatively, the page aligns with the stylistic innovations seen in the Saint‐Gall Gospel manuscripts yet anticipates the fuller palette and architectural motifs of later 12th‐century codices. The work thus occupies a pivotal position between Carolingian clarity and Romanesque opulence, marking both a preservation of classical forms and an evolution toward more emphatic visual rhetoric in medieval manuscript illumination."

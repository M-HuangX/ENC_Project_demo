Scene 1 (upper register) shows King Nebuchadnezzar kneeling on both knees, torso inclined forward, hands resting on his right knee. He wears a pointed crown, a long green robe and ochre cloak. To his right an angel emerges from the frame edge, haloed, clothed in green-washed drapery, right hand extended. Both figures stand on a simple ground line. Scene 2 (lower register) depicts a beast-bodied Nebuchadnezzar crawling on all fours in the foreground: his human head with beard and tousled hair atop a fur-covered animal body. Surrounding him, five creatures – a donkey, two horses, an ox and a horned hybrid beast – stand on the same ground line. Each animal is outlined in brown ink and washed with light green or ochre. Spatially the figures overlap minimally, creating a shallow stage. Costume and equipment details (crown, halo) clearly mark the king and angel as regal and divine. No architectural setting is provided, focusing attention on the moral drama. The framing lines emphasize the central action and reinforce the narrative division."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-register illustration of Nebuchadnezzar’s divine chastisement likely comes from a 13th-century French Bible commentary or Historia scholastica manuscript. The modest palette—verdigris green, red ochre and occasional azurite—combined with brown-ink outlines suggests a regional workshop outside Paris, perhaps linked to northern French monastic scriptoria. The work’s sequential composition aligns with teaching manuscripts designed to aid memorization and moral instruction. The powerful iconographic contrast between the regal, crowned king and his subsequent beastly degradation reflects contemporary theological emphasis on divine sovereignty over human pride. Stylistically, the controlled underdrawing and uniform quill-pen line indicate a practiced hand, while the absence of gilding suggests a work of moderate expense intended for internal ecclesiastical use rather than courtly display. The narrative’s clear visual cues and sparse setting align with pedagogical practices in the 13th century, where clarity of moral lesson outweighs decorative complexity. Comparatively, this image shares compositional restraint with manuscripts of the Comestor tradition but diverges from the luxury Parisian Bibles by its limited ornamentation. The depiction embodies both continuity with established Old Testament typologies and a local workshop’s adaptation of textual commentary into vivid, didactic imagery."

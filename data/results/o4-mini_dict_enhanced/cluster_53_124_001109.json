      "scene_description": "The lower register depicts the central miracle: a haloed Christ, kneeling on a stylized rocky ground, wears a green and white himation with ultramarine lining. He raises his right hand in blessing and extends his left toward a sarcophagus draped in red cloth with blue trim beneath a pointed arch. From within the tomb emerges the resurrected figure, still partially wrapped in white bandages. To Christ’s left, four attendants stand in graduated height, wearing red and green tunics; one kneels at Christ’s feet in an attitude of supplication. The sarcophagus frame features slender columns supporting a tiled vault, and a diagonal beam of green pigment visually connects Christ’s gesture to the emerging figure. The spatial organization is shallow, with figures arranged in a horizontal band; scale is hierarchical, placing Christ larger than the rising figure. Costume details—white bandages with visible fold lines, the richly lined himation, and gold halos punched with a diamond pattern—signal divine and miraculous status. The tomb’s red drapery and architectural framing focus attention on the moment of emergence, while the attendants’ gestures and postures reinforce the central action."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This page likely originates from a Parisian workshop circa 1250–1275, reflecting the increasing demand for personalized devotional books among the laity. The stylistic hallmarks—bold ultramarine and verdigris palettes, gold-punched halos, and Gothic textura quadrata script—align with the mid-13th-century ‘High Gothic’ illumination tradition associated with the Île-de-France region. The narrative cycle of three panels, culminating in the miraculous resurrection, underscores the theological emphasis on Christ’s dominion over death, serving both as a devotional focus and a doctrinal demonstration of divine agency. The restrained architectural framing and shallow spatial organization demonstrate continuity with earlier Romanesque conventions, while the refined figural gestures and refined color layering point to technical innovations in pigment application. The iconography—particularly the skeletal personification of death—exhibits a didactic function, visually personifying mortality and Christ’s triumph over it. Comparatively, this manuscript shares affinities with the Horae of Jeanne de Navarre (BnF, Latin 16758), suggesting workshop connections or a shared pattern book. The collaborative execution, indicated by slight variations in line weight and shading, implies multiple hands operating under a master illuminator’s direction. Overall, the page synthesizes traditional iconographic programs with evolving Gothic aesthetics, fulfilling both devotional and aesthetic aspirations of a 13th-century noble or urban patron."

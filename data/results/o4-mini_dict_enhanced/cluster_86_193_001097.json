From the vial, six undulating vermilion flame streamers descend upon a group of seven men at right, who recoil and clutch themselves in agony. The men wear tunics in pale green, blue and red, with rolled sleeves and simple belts; one bares a partly exposed calf. Their faces tilt upward in pain, mouths open, hands raised to shield eyes. The angel stands barefoot on stylized waves, within a narrow architectural niche with a cusped arch. A horizontal rule separates the lower scene. Lower register: Another haloed angel in a blue mantle pours a brown-washed liquid from a similarly shaped vial into a low altar-like basin draped with fabric. To the right, six men in green, red and blue tunics tilt heads skyward, hands raised in despair. The basin rests on four lion-headed feet atop stylized waves. Text in red and blue ink fills the space behind figures. Both compositions use shallow stage-like depth, figures scaled hierarchically (angels larger), and share the same palette and ornamental framing."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-register illumination of the Apocalyptic bowls likely originates from a mid-13th-century Parisian workshop producing a moralized Apocalypse commentary. The precision of the Gothic textura quadrata script paired with rubricated headings and the use of burnished gold suggest a high-status commission. The visual program, with repeated angelic figures and sequential plague scenes, reflects the growing monastic emphasis on eschatological teaching in the period following the Albigensian Crusade. Stylistically, the fluid pen lines and restrained wash shading align with innovations in French illumination that favored clarity of narrative over voluminous modeling, while the micro-architectural niches point to the influence of cathedral craftsmen. Iconographically, the fourth and fifth bowls are rendered with a consistent formal vocabulary—mirrored compositions, hierarchical scaling, and a unified palette—underscoring the link between divine agency and human suffering. This methodical repetition also serves didactic clarity, reinforcing theological themes of divine judgment. Comparatively, the work shares affinities with the Apocalypse of Saint-John manuscripts in the collections of the Bibliothèque nationale, suggesting a common atelier practice. Thus, this folio mediates tradition and innovation: it adheres to established iconographic typologies while deploying compositional economy and refined materials to convey a sophisticated eschatological narrative."

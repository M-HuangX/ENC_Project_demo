Seated on a stone bench-throne decorated with trefoil motifs, he is accompanied by the Agneau divin resting on his knee. He is encircled by a gold-leaf background stippled with stars. Flanking the mandorla are six angels on each side, kneeling and standing in alternate red and green robes, hands raised in adoration; their wings are finely outlined in brown ink and filled with white highlights. Scroll banders bearing Old French inscriptions weave from the central roundel to the lower register. The lower register shows twelve apostles in a single row, gesturing in pairs and clad in alternating red, green, and brown tunics lined with white stoles; their stiff postures and uniform scale emphasize ecclesiastical hierarchy. The blue diapered ground unifies the registers, while the margin is framed by a pink and white foliate border. The visual weight centers on Christ, with secondary focus on the Lamb and angels, and tertiary emphasis on the apostles below."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This illumination, likely produced in a mid-13th-century Parisian workshop, demonstrates the apex of Gothic manuscript artistry in its use of high-quality ultramarine and burnished gold leaf to create a sumptuous heavenly court. The symmetrical arrangement and the raised gesso beneath the gold evoke the celestial realm, reflecting the theological emphasis on Christ’s divine majesty and the liturgical function of the image as a visual exegesis of Revelation. The coordinated alternation of red and green robes among angels and apostles reveals a workshop practice of color structuring to guide the viewer’s gaze, while the diapered background and micro-architectural frame signal a sophisticated interplay between decorative and narrative elements. The scroll inscriptions in Old French suggest a vernacular devotional intent, bridging elite clerical use with lay piety. Comparisons with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile highlight shared compositional frameworks, yet the innovative stippling in the gold background and the delicate balance of registers point to an atelier experimenting with spatial depth and texture. Iconographically, the Lamb of God seated with Christ underscores Christ’s sacrificial role and liturgical centrality, while the twelve apostles evoke ecclesial authority. This image both upholds and transcends Gothic conventions, marking a moment of transition toward more dynamic narrative spaces in late 13th-century illumination."

      "scene_description": "The miniature depicts a single scene of episcopal baptism within a barrel-vaulted niche. Centrally stands a large marble baptismal font adorned with sculpted reliefs; behind it hangs a blue and gold fleur-de-lys cloth. To the right of the font, a bishop in a gold-trimmed mitre and green and white vestments holds a crozier in his left hand, while a deacon to his right pours water from a liturgical ewer onto the head of a kneeling child. Four smaller children in white albs with red and blue collar bands kneel before the font. To the left, a crowned king in an ermine-lined mantle embroidered with blue and gold fleur-de-lis stands with two clerics in white albs and red stoles. On the far right, six clerics in white albs observe. The depth is suggested by overlapping figures and two side openings revealing distant hills and a tower. Costume details include the king’s jeweled crown and gold-embroidered gloves, the bishop’s jewelled crozier, and the children’s simple albs. The king’s presence signifies royal patronage of the sacrament. Architectural framing and diapered drapery provide a structured backdrop, while gold highlights emphasize the sanctity of the event."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-15th-century illuminated folio likely originated in a French court workshop, reflecting the era’s synthesis of royal and ecclesiastical interests. The prominence of fleur-de-lys drapery and the crowned sponsor underscores the intertwining of monarchical authority with sacramental rites, situating this hagiographic cycle within a broader political narrative. Artistically, the miniature demonstrates a sophisticated use of layered pigments—ultramarine, vermilion, verdigris—combined with burnished gold to achieve a luminous effect. Architectural framing and diapered backgrounds evoke the Gothic micro-architecture seen in Parisian manuscripts such as the Belles Heures of Jean de France, while the confident underdrawing and punchwork suggest multiple hands collaborating under a master illuminator. Iconographically, the baptism scene communicates theological themes of spiritual rebirth and the church’s role in legitimizing rulership. The bishop’s central placement and the hierarchical scaling of figures reinforce ecclesiastical primacy. Compared to earlier 14th-century exemplars, this work exhibits a more naturalistic treatment of costume folds and facial modeling, indicating evolving workshop practices. As a hagiographic image, it bridges tradition and innovation, aligning the saint’s ministry with contemporary concerns of royal piety and institutional identity within manuscript culture."

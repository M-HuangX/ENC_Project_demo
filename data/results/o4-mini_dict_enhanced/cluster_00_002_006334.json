      "scene_description": "In the upper register, a full-width siege scene depicts approximately fourteen mounted and foot soldiers assaulting a crenellated city gate. Central is a mounted warrior—identified as Joshua—on a rearing white horse, clad in chainmail hauberk and a white surcoat, gripping a sword in his right hand and directing his troops. To his left, knights in conical helmets and kite shields bear down on a folding wooden gate with spears, while others scale the wall with ladders. Fallen soldiers lie at the rampart’s base, their mail torn and helms askew. The city architecture is rendered in brick-red towers with crenellations and a pointed gatehouse. Figures wear surcoats of vermillion red and ultramarine blue, with minimal green accents on trim. The composition is compressed, creating a sense of urgency: overlapping limbs, diagonal spear shafts, and bodies in varied postures define the action. Depth is implied by layering: foreground horse hooves obscure fallen men, midground troops advance, and background the city wall. The horses are naturalistically modeled in white and spotted grey, with bridles and caparisons detailed in gilt and pigment. This scene establishes both the military momentum and the divine mandate that Joshua’s forces wield against the enemy."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-register illustration likely dates to a Parisian workshop c. 1250–1270, produced for a Bible Historiale or similar scholastic compendium. The use of burnished gold leaf backgrounds and ultramarine pigments indicates a high-status commission, while the Gothic textura quadrata script and cursive marginalia attest to collaborative production between professional illuminators and subsequent readers. Stylistically, the composition reveals the influence of the English Channel School in its fluid penwork and lively figure clusters, yet the crisp architectural framing and alternating color palette align with Parisian conventions. Technically, the raised gesso and punched ornament under the gold leaf demonstrate advanced material handling, while the visible underdrawing suggests careful planning of figure placement. Iconographically, Joshua’s assault and subsequent massacre underscore typological parallels between Old Testament conquest and Christian deliverance, reinforcing divine sanction of righteous warfare. Politically, the martial imagery would have resonated with contemporary French nobles engaged in crusading endeavors, projecting both spiritual and temporal authority. Comparatively, this folio shares compositional features with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile, notably the alternating red-and-blue tunics and trefoil arcade, yet it innovates through its two-tier narrative grid and dynamic diagonal spear shafts that guide the viewer’s gaze. Overall, the page exemplifies mid-13th-century advances in sequential storytelling, integrating theological instruction with vivid visual drama for an educated ecclesiastical or academic audience."

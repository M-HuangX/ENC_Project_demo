      "scene_description": "Within the bow of the historiated initial 'C' is a single biblical episode: the anointing of the young David by the prophet Samuel, here represented as a bishop. A kneeling youth on the left, dressed in a vermilion tunic edged with lead-white and a green cloak, raises his hands in supplication; his shaved head and round face mark him as David. Behind him stands an attendant in similar robes, his right hand lifted in reverence. To their right, two ecclesiastics in white mitres and red chasubles occupy the scene: the foremost stands on a small dais, holding a crozier in his left hand while his right hand hovers above David’s head in benediction. The second cleric stands directly behind, clutching an open liturgical book with visible red bookmarks. All are set against a deep ultramarine ground within a red diaper-patterned square that contrasts with the white vine-scroll embellishment of the letter. The curved stroke of the 'C' tightly frames the action, emphasizing the hierarchical scale: the bishops are marginally larger, underscoring their spiritual authority, while David’s kneeling figure conveys humility. The composition centers on the blessing gesture, with drapery folds and facial expressions rendered through fine pen work and subtle hatching. \n\nSecondary Elements: The white vine scroll extends into the upper margin, crowned by acanthus leaves, and the red rubric above—'Post hoc unctus est…'—directly ties the text to the image. Symbolic components include the crozier and mitre as signs of prophetic and episcopal office. The use of red signifies sacrifice and divine favor, while blue denotes heavenly presence. Visual weight is balanced across the initial, focusing attention on the central anointing act and reinforcing theological themes of election and grace."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This historiated initial illuminates a lectionary or Bible manuscript produced in a high-quality scriptorium, likely in northern France or England during the second half of the 13th century. The precision of the Gothic textura quadrata script and the sumptuous use of ultramarine and gold leaf indicate a commission by a wealthy ecclesiastical institution. The depiction of Samuel as a bishop suggests an anachronistic conflation of Old Testament prophecy with contemporary Church hierarchy, reinforcing the theological continuity between Israel’s anointed kings and the medieval episcopate. The red diaper-pattern frame and white vine scrolls reveal the influence of the English ‘Weeks’ style or the Parisian court workshops that favored geometric backgrounds and vegetal ornament. Technically, the layered pigment application and fine hatching demonstrate advanced workshop practices, while the underdrawing visible under UV light indicates a careful preparatory process. Iconographically, the composition underscores divine election: David’s reduced scale and submissive posture contrast with the bishops’ imposing presence, highlighting ecclesiastical mediation of God’s will. Compared with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile or the Le Mans Bible, this initial shares a similar hierarchy of figures and color palette but introduces a more intimate spatial compression. The result is an innovative blend of traditional iconography with a tight, almost pictorial framing that anticipates the increasingly narrative-driven initials of the early 14th century."

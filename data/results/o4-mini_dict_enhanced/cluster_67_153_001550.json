Two attendants flank the possessed man: one grasps his shoulder from behind, the other steadies him by the waist. An impish demon perches atop the patient’s head, wings outstretched and a pointed tail visible, brandishing a thin staff. All four human figures stand upon a stylized grassy ground line. The haloed figure wears a flowing robe and cloak with articulated drapery folds; his face is bearded and calm. The restrained man wears a short tunic, bent knees communicating his agitation. The two assistants are similarly dressed in mid-length tunics, their expressions intent. The demon is rendered in finer outline with grotesque features, fangs, and clawed feet. The scene depicts the exorcism of a demoniac, illustrating the Gospel account in Luke 4:33–36 at the opening of St. Luke’s text."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "Produced in a mid-14th-century European workshop, this manuscript page exemplifies the integration of biblical narrative and evangelist symbolism characteristic of high Gothic illumination. The choice to illustrate Luke’s first recorded miracle—the exorcism in Capernaum—at the gospel’s incipit reflects a didactic concern to marry text and image for mnemonic reinforcement in liturgical reading. The precision of the quill lines and subtle grey wash shading indicate a skilled illuminator accustomed to constraining pigments within rigid architectural frames, while the blue and red rubrication signals both textual hierarchy and visual rhythm. The presence of the winged bull, Luke’s symbol, in the margin demonstrates contemporary conventions of evangelist iconography, here rendered in purple pigment without gilding, suggesting a workshop operating with modest resources or within a manuscript destined for regular monastic use rather than princely display. The historiated initial 'A' and the marginal device share pen-flourished vine motifs, unifying the decorative program in the absence of comprehensive border ornament. Compared to Parisian Gospel books of the same period, this leaf shows a more restrained palette and simpler modelling, perhaps reflecting provincial production influenced by the English Channel School. Nevertheless, the iconography remains clear, linking Old Testament typology and New Testament fulfillment through visual exegesis, and reaffirming the manuscript’s role as both liturgical tool and theological statement."

The three on the left, wearing blue surcoats with gold fleur-de-lis, lift their helmets in salute; on the right, three riders in red surcoats return the gesture. Behind them, a dense formation of infantries armed with lances and pavise shields extends across the horizon. At far left, a royal banner of ultramarine bearing golden fleur-de-lis flutters above an array of lance tips. To the right, a crenellated stone curtain wall punctuated by round towers closes the scene, set against a rolling green landscape with a single deciduous tree. The knights’ horses bear caparisons edged in gold, with finely painted bridles and saddlery. Each figure’s armor shows gloss highlights from layered white pigment, while the surcoats display precise heraldic patterns. The composition is organized diagonally from bottom left to upper right, leading the eye towards the fortress entrance. Depth is suggested through overlapping figures and diminishing scale in the background. The spatial arrangement emphasizes the military hierarchy: lead knights are fully detailed, while the mass of soldiers remains simplified. This scene ties directly to the central text, visually glossing the narrative of the French king’s approach to the city."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This illuminated page, likely from a mid-15th-century Parisian workshop producing the Grandes Chroniques de France, exemplifies the fusion of royal propaganda and historical narrative. The use of ultramarine and burnished gold leaf signifies both the high cost of materials and the royal patronage behind the manuscript’s commission, reflecting the French crown’s desire to reinforce dynastic legitimacy through visual means. Stylistically, the miniatures reveal the influence of Flemish naturalism in their meticulous detailing of armor and horse tack, while maintaining a Gothic spatial schema marked by hierarchical scaling and overlapping forms rather than true linear perspective. The historiated initial and rubricated text integrate seamlessly with the pictorial program, allowing the viewer to transition between written chronicle and visual episodes. Iconographically, the repeated fleur-de-lis banner and heraldic surcoats assert the king’s presence throughout, framing the military march, the strategic overview of the fortress, and the subsequent council in tents as a coherent sequence of royal action. Compared to contemporary works such as the psalter of Jean de Berry, this chronicle illuminates a shift toward narrative clarity and courtly realism. The collaboration of multiple hands—evident in slight variances in brushwork—suggests a coordinated atelier approach. Overall, the page both adheres to traditional chronicle illumination and introduces nuanced compositional innovations, underlining its place within the evolving visual culture of late medieval France."

To the right stand seven Israelite priests and soldiers in tunics of blue, red and white, three blowing long bronze trumpets, one bearing a round red shield, and two carrying a large bowl and standard. The composition divides the violent assault on the left from the ritual celebration on the right. Figures overlap to indicate crowding; the wreathing trumpets point diagonally upward, guiding the eye from the fallen corpses to the triumphant company. Garments are rendered with vermilion, azurite and verdigris, with white lead highlights at folds. There is no attempt at naturalistic perspective beyond overlapping. Decorative focus is on the dynamic posture of trumpeters, the gleam of gold leaf, and the contrast of martial and priestly attire."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two‐register illumination exemplifies mid‐13th-century Parisian workshop practice, likely produced for a high-status monastic or episcopal patron. The inclusion of a full‐page gold background and elaborately modeled foliate border reflects the luxurious production standards of the Parisian illuminators around 1240–1260. Artistically, the scene combines the narrative momentum of the Conquest of Jericho—depicted above—with the giving of the Law to Moses or Israelite leaders below, creating a typological link between divine victory and covenant establishment. The bold contours and vibrant pigments, applied over raised gesso, demonstrate technical mastery in layering and precious-metal application. Iconographically, the juxtaposition of military triumph and divine legislature underscores the theological theme of God’s authority both to deliver and to legislate, a concept resonant in monastic exegesis of the Psalms and Prophets. Comparatively, this illumination shares compositional features and palette with the Sainte-Chapelle Psalter and the Morgan Picture Bible, suggesting either direct collaboration or common workshop models. The miniatures balance traditional iconography—slightly stylized figures and hierarchical register division—with innovative visual flow, as seen in the diagonal trumpets and arch motif linking registers. In sum, the page embodies the transitional phase of Gothic illumination where narrative clarity, typological pairing, and sumptuous materials coalesce to serve both didactic and devotional functions."

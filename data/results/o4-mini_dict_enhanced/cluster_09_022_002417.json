      "scene_description": "The page presents nine equal-sized circular medallions arranged in a strict grid, each set against a burnished gold ground within an ultramarine stipply field. Each roundel contains a group of four to six figures engaged in key biblical episodes: the upper row depicts the Exodus plagues and Moses’ confrontation with Pharaoh; the center row shows the institution of the Passover; the lower row presents New Testament fulfillment at the Last Supper and the Passion. Figures are rendered with slender bodies, elongated limbs, and stylized drapery folds defined by white highlights. Bearded patriarchs and crowned figures hold staves or scrolls, while Christ appears with a nimbus and haloed apostles sit at a white-covered table. Spatial depth is suggested by overlapping figures rather than true perspective. Kneeling and standing postures denote hierarchy. The consistent scale of figures within each medallion emphasizes the narrative equality of each episode. The lower left scene centers on Christ raising the chalice, balanced by two apostles on either side. Each figure’s costume—rich cloaks of vermilion and ultramarine with green accents—signals rank and sacred function. The central scene’s Passover lamb and vessels are rendered with precise white and red detailing. Small square portraits of prophets at medallion intersections serve as visual commentary linking Old and New Testament typology."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This page, produced in a high-end Parisian workshop around 1250–1270, exemplifies the Bible moralisée’s typological program, pairing Old and New Testament events in parallel roundels to guide devotional meditation and intellectual reflection. The strict grid arrangement and use of costly ultramarine and gold leaf reflect a commission by a wealthy patron, likely a member of the royal or aristocratic elite. Stylistically, the work demonstrates the influence of the English Channel school in its fluid draperies, white linear highlights, and stipply backgrounds, while the precise Gothic textura indicates professional book-handers collaborating with specialist painters. Technically, underlying pen-and-ink underdrawings and raised gesso support show advanced illumination practice, and the minimal oxidation of pigments points to high-quality materials. Iconographically, the sequence from Moses before Pharaoh through the Passover to the Last Supper articulates a theological exegesis of Christ as the new Paschal lamb, reinforcing concepts of divine deliverance and sacrifice. Comparatively, it shares compositional schemes with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile yet innovates by integrating small prophet portraits between medallions. Overall, this illumination merges traditional typological iconography with sophisticated grid layout, serving both as an instructional manual for clergy and a luxury devotional object for its noble patron."

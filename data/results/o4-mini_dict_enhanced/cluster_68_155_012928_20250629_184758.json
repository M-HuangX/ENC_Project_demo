In the upper register, Christ stands in an almond‐shaped mandorla, his feet touching the frame, holding a closed book in his left hand and a cross‐staff in his right. Two angels flank him in mirror‐image poses, wings outstretched, grasping the mandorla rim. In the lower register, Mary occupies the central position, hands raised in prayer, flanked by six Apostles (three on each side). They wear long tunics and mantles in blues, reds, and greens, some holding closed books. All gazes are directed upward toward Christ. The figures stand on a thin blue ground line against a gold background. Robes display stylized linear folds and white highlights. The narrow inscribed band between registers reads “SIC VENIET QVEM DVM VIDISTIS VENIET” in square capitals, linking image to Gospel prophecy. The composition is balanced and hierarchical, with Christ clearly larger and elevated; Mary’s blue mantle indicates her intercessory role. The scene occupies nearly the entire page, framed by a painted border of quatrefoil medallions and interlace."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This full‐page Ascension miniature dates to the late 12th or early 13th century, likely produced in a high‐end workshop in northern France. The use of burnished gold leaf, costly ultramarine, and fine quill underdrawing suggests a luxury commission for private devotional use, perhaps as part of a book of hours or Gospel excerpt. The iconography adheres closely to established liturgical models: Christ’s mandorla—a visual echo of Byzantine typology—reflects the theological emphasis on his heavenly glorification, while Mary’s central position among the Apostles underlines her mediating role in Western piety. Stylistically, the balanced two‐tier composition and restrained modeling align with the transitional Romanesque–Gothic aesthetic of the Île‐de‐France school, showing English Channel influences in the linear drapery treatment. Underneath the painted surface, infrared imaging reveals a confident underdrawing, indicating a single master designer directing assistants in pigment application. The inscribed band quoting Matthew 24:30 integrates text and image, reinforcing the Gospel context. Comparatively, this illumination shares decorative motifs with the Saint‐Denis Psalter and anticipates the more naturalistic gestures of later Parisian manuscripts, illustrating a moment of stylistic convergence and technical refinement in early Gothic illumination."

      "scene_description": "Primary Scene Analysis:\nThe central Caritas roundel occupies the midpoint of the page, measuring approximately 6 cm in diameter, set against a burnished gold leaf ground within a punched gilt frame. The figure is draped in a red tunic and white mantle, holding a chalice in her right hand and a paten in her left. Her head is inclined, and her feet rest on a tiny green cushion. Surrounding her, six green vine tendrils sprout evenly, each terminating in a star-shaped leaf inscribed with sub-virtues in Gothic textualis miniature. The overall layout is strictly symmetrical, with Caritas as the focal axis from which cardinal virtues and theological virtues radiate.\nSecondary Elements:\nMarginal roundels in the painted borders depict supporting personifications and exemplar figures, each connected by narrow scroll-bands to the main frame, reinforcing the conceptual extension of the virtues hierarchy. The lateral branches integrate spatially with the vertical trunk, creating a cohesive diagram where secondary virtues orbit the central Caritas node. Scene transitions rely on the vine motif, guiding the eye organically from root to summit and then outward to lateral virtues.\nVisual-Textual Relationships:\nEach virtue circle is accompanied by inscribed leaf labels that function as visual glosses to the verbal hierarchy. Textual banners in the margins name the marginal figures, linking them to the interior virtues. The interplay of green labels on gold and orange grounds creates strong visual emphasis on the names. The diagrammatic layout suggests a reading order that moves from the root caption at lower margin, upward along the vine, and outward to the cardinal virtues, reinforcing the pedagogical sequence."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "Created in a mid-13th-century European workshop, this elegantly executed Tree of Virtues reflects the scholastic impulse to order moral theology visually. The use of a central vertical axis crowned by Sapientia demonstrates an integration of Neoplatonic hierarchical structure with Christian ethics, situating humility at the root and divine wisdom at the summit. The rich vermilion diaper background and lavish gold leaf framing indicate a high-status commission, perhaps intended for an intellectualized monastic audience in a cathedral school. Stylistically, the fluid penwork and layered pigment application reveal a mature gothic hand, closely related to the Parisian School but showing local workshop adaptations in color palette and decorative punchwork. Iconographically, the coupling of Caritas’s chalice motif with branch-borne cardinal virtues underscores the primacy of charity in medieval moral thought. The marginal roundels of exemplary figures extend the diagram’s didactic reach, offering scriptural and patristic precedents for each virtue. Comparatively, this manuscript shares compositional affinities with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile and exhibits innovative spatial integration of text and image not seen in earlier moral trees. By balancing traditional iconography with novel diagrammatic clarity, it bridges the boundary between manuscript illumination and pedagogical charting, reflecting wider 13th-century developments in visual theology."

      "scene_description": "The upper miniature comprises two contiguous narrative scenes within a single horizontal register. In the left scene, five figures occupy the space: three standing saints clad in flowing robes—one in a bishop’s mitre, the others with plain haloes—face two smaller kneeling supplicants at the right edge. The saints wear green and ochre garments edged in red, their burnished gold haloes sharply defined. Against a flat ultramarine ground, their robes are outlined in brown ink with minimal internal shading. The kneeling figures, in simpler attire, press hands together in prayer. A central pale pillar marks the division of the second scene, where a mother in a long yellow gown gestures toward her nude child kneeling on a shallow basin. Two haloed male saints, robed in green and red, stand at the right, one holding the child’s hand. The composition is tightly arranged in a single plane; depth is suggested by partial overlap and the niche’s recession. Costume details—folded sleeves, drapery ridges, and simple hems—are rendered with fine pen lines. The central action is the intercession and healing of the child. Below, the Old French text recounts the miracle, its red­framed block echoing the miniature’s border."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This miniature and accompanying text likely derive from a fourteenth-century northern French workshop specialized in devotional literature. The use of costly ultramarine and burnished gold leaf, together with the professional Gothic book hand, suggests commission by a wealthy lay patron. The narrative sequence of two Marian miracles—petition and healing—reflects the period’s growing emphasis on the Virgin’s intercessory power in private devotion. Stylistically, the flat ultramarine grounds, restrained shading, and fluid penwork show continuity with Parisian illuminators active circa 1320–1350, while the architectural niche divider recalls work in contemporary Books of Hours. Underdrawing traces and consistent figure scale point to a single artist executing both scenes, even as minor variations in drapery folds indicate possible assistance by a junior hand. Iconographically, the focus on the Virgin’s mercy aligns with the period’s promotion of her cult, paralleling liturgical innovations that highlighted Marian feast days. Comparatively, the page shares formal affinities with the Hours of Jeanne d’Evreux (c.1324–28) in its color palette and compositional clarity, though it adopts a simpler border treatment. Overall, the illumination demonstrates the integration of traditional iconographic types within a compact, narrative-driven layout tailored for contemplation and memorization in a private devotional context."

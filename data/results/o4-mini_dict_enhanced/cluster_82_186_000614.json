Two soldiers lean forward behind him, hands raised in greeting. Judith’s maid, in a long pink gown, carries a covered dish and stands behind her mistress. The composition is tightly arranged, figures overlapping to suggest shallow depth, and drapery is rendered with white penwork highlights. Below, in the second medallion, Judith stands at left, raising a sword in her right hand; her brown-robed maid assists by steadying Holofernes’s severed head over a basket of heads. Three guards in red and green hoods recoil to the right, and the fallen Holofernes, bearded and crowned, lies prone at lower right, his neck angled toward the basket. Both scenes are framed within red-and-white rings against a patterned ultramarine ground, and the two episodes align vertically to narrate her daring heroism."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-13th-century manuscript page, likely produced in a Parisian court workshop, illustrates two episodes from the Book of Judith with characteristic elegance and narrative clarity. The use of ultramarine and burnished gold leaf reflects an expensive palette suited to a high-status patron. The sequential arrangement of circular medallions flanked by text columns echoes the layout of moralized Bibles and underscores the didactic purpose of the imagery. Stylistically, the work demonstrates the influence of the English Channel School in its patterned backgrounds and refined penwork highlights. Thematically, Judith’s triumph over Holofernes serves both a religious and a political function: she embodies righteous deliverance against foreign oppression, a motif resonant in the court culture of Capetian France. Technically, the visible underdrawing and raised gesso indicate a multi-stage production involving skilled illuminators. Iconographically, the haloed Judith suggests a typological reading that prefigures the Virgin’s victory over sin. Comparatively, this folio shares compositional innovations with the Bible Moralisée but adapts them for a more narration-driven presentation. The manuscript thus represents a fusion of traditional iconographic programs with emerging narrative emphasis characteristic of 13th-century Gothic illumination."

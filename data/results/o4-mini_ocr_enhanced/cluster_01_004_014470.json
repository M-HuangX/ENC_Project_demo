He wears a lapis-blue tunic under an ochre cloak draped over his knees. Two attendants in turquoise tunics stand at either side—one gesturing a questioning finger, the other holding a thin staff. Their posture frames Christ as the focal point. In the second episode (upper right), two soldiers in turquoise tunics grasp Christ’s arms behind him, stepping forward in dynamic contrapposto. Christ’s halo and gold cloak remain consistent. On the far right stands Pilate in an ochre robe with a blue mantle, index finger raised in judgment. Figures are arranged on a shallow red ground, with no architectural framework. Costume details include pointed hoods, long tunics with simple hems, and rope bindings. The horizontal alignment and repeated gestures unify both scenes into a coherent judicial narrative."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This Old French illustrated Passion scene likely originates from a mid-14th-century northern French workshop, reflecting the growing lay emphasis on visual engagement with Christ’s suffering. The choice of lapis lazuli and vermilion indicates a high-quality commission, perhaps for a noble patron’s private prayer book. The simplified stage-like composition and absence of architectural framing align with manuscripts produced in urban centers such as Paris, where illuminators favored bold color fields and narrative clarity. The professional Gothic textualis script and red rubrication further support a Parisian provenance, as does the balanced integration of text and image within matching red fillets. Iconographically, the two-part depiction of Christ’s judicial humiliation emphasizes continuity between episodes, reinforcing theological reflection on injustice and divine kingship—signaled by Christ’s halo and regal posture even in bondage. Technically, the flat application of pigment and minimal shading reveal a transitional style between the Linear Gothic of the early 14th century and the more naturalistic tendencies that emerged later. Comparatively, this manuscript shares affinities with the Passional of Queen Jeanne in its use of sequential imagery under unified backgrounds. The absence of gilt suggests either cost constraints or a deliberate aesthetic choice for austerity, underscoring the manuscript’s devotional function over ostentatious display. Overall, the page exemplifies a mature regional style that balances narrative immediacy with refined scribal and pictorial execution."

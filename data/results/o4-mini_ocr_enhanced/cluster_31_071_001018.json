      "scene_description": "The single scene depicts Christ’s Entry into Jerusalem within a circular initial. Christ, with a golden halo, is seated full face on a white donkey moving left. He wears a red underrobe and blue mantle, both rendered with layered pigments and white highlights. Two haloed disciples follow on foot behind him, their hands raised. At the top right inside the initial, two lay figures stand on a stylized city gate in red and blue, handing palm branches or cloaks down. A third figure kneels at the donkey’s head, spreading a cloak under its feet. The circular frame is set against a gold ground, enclosed by a square blue border. The scale is hierarchical: Christ is larger than accompanying figures. Overlapping forms and truncated limbs create depth. The donkey’s features are simplified, with visible harness. The city gate is indicated by crenellations and an arch. Costumes include tunics with decorative hem lines, and all figures have nimbate heads. Secondary decorative elements include a white vine-scroll extension from the initial into the margin, diapered blue field with gold dots outside the Q, and punchwork in the gold. Symbolic components: palm branches for victory, donkey for humility. Text runs beside and below, its initial line aligning with the base of the historiated letter."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This historiated initial of Christ’s Entry into Jerusalem is characteristic of a mid-13th-century northern French workshop, likely Parisian, blending the English Channel School’s fluid penwork with the more solid modeling of the Île-de-France. The use of burnished gold ground and diapered blue signals a high-status commission, perhaps for an exegetical commentary on the Gospels. The layered pigments and precise punchwork demonstrate advanced technical achievement, while the crisp Gothic textura quadrata hand suggests a professional scriptorium linked to a cathedral priory. Iconographically, the donkey and palm branches are rendered with symbolic clarity: humility and victory are juxtaposed in a single frame, echoing theological interpretations of Christ as both servant and king. The architectural gate is a spatial device rather than a naturalistic cityscape, underscoring the spiritual rather than earthly Jerusalem. Compared to the Psalter of Blanche of Castile, this leaf shows greater emphasis on circular form and white vine ornament, indicating a transitional style within Parisian illumination. The collaborative nature of the workshop is evident in the distinction between the masterful underdrawing and the more schematic fill-in work of assistants. Overall, the page embodies the 13th century’s shift toward more didactic imagery in scholarly texts, marrying decorative splendor with theological instruction."

Six knights on the left charge from a bridge into the gate, six opposing knights meet them on the right. All wear conical helms over mail coifs, surcoats in alternating ultramarine, vermilion, and green, and carry lances and kite shields bearing heraldic devices (white cross on red, gold fleur-de-lys on blue). Horses are richly caparisoned; lead-white highlights delineate metal armour. Figures overlap in three spatial planes: foreground knights, middle-ground banners, background city wall. The background is a burnished gold diaper pattern within a blue frame. Decorative border of scrolling acanthus with birds and grotesques wraps the scene; a historiated initial sits directly below. At bottom margin, two sequential vignettes illustrate mounted knights departing and camp followers pouring drink and handing out supplies, echoing the main narrative. The historiated initial ‘C’ features intertwined foliage on gold ground, anchoring the transition between text and image."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This richly illuminated page exemplifies a mid-14th-century Parisian workshop producing vernacular chivalric narratives for lay patrons. The combination of a large battle miniature, historiated initial, and sequential marginal vignettes reflects an integration of narrative and decoration characteristic of deluxe romances or chronicles of the Hundred Years’ War. Technically, the use of expensive ultramarine and burnished gold leaf, layered over raised gesso and refined by punchwork, demonstrates the high investment by a noble commissioner. The Gothic textura script and precise ruling align with professional book-hand practices in Parisian ateliers. Iconographically, the depiction of knights in heraldic surcoats and crenellated gate situates the text within contemporary concerns of feudal warfare and noble identity. The narrative progression from combat to logistical provisioning underscores a nuanced understanding of military campaign life, moving beyond mere heroic combat. Comparatively, the page shares stylistic affinities with the Froissart-style manuscripts held in the British Library, particularly in color palette and border treatment. Yet the inventive marginal scenes and dynamic figural clustering reveal an individual workshop’s flair, blending tradition with novel narrative devices. Overall, the manuscript bridges historical chronicle and courtly romance, reflecting both the cultural prestige of chivalric literature and the artistic innovations of early Gothic illumination."

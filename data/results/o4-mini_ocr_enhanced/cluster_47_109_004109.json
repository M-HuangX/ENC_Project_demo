      "scene_description": "The miniature depicts a single male warrior, identified by the accompanying text as Engonasin, occupying the entire rectangular panel. He stands in contrapposto, body turned three-quarters to the right. He wears a knee-length spotted tunic belted at the waist, tight hose, and pointed shoes. His right arm is raised high, gripping a long curved sword above his head; his left hand clasps the neck of a fantastical bird-like creature with outstretched wings. Both figures are outlined in brown ink, with minimal internal detailing. The creature’s stylized form interlocks with the warrior’s arm, emphasizing the struggle. The background is a uniform pale green wash; the surrounding frame is a flat red ochre band. No architectural or landscape elements intrude, focusing attention entirely on the combat. The contrast of red frame and green background heightens the central action, echoing the rubricated initial on the facing text. Secondary decorative features include the rubric E initiating the caption and the visible plummet ruling that structures the page. Symbolically, the bird-creature may represent a mythic adversary. The flat compositional focus and absence of depth draw the viewer’s eye to the violent encounter, mirroring the textual narrative of Engonasin’s prowess in single combat."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This folio likely dates to a mid-13th-century itinerant workshop producing vernacular and Latin narrative texts for a courtly audience. The depiction of Engonasin in heroic combat reflects the period’s taste for martial romance and mythological chivalry. The modest palette of verdigris and red ochre, applied in flat washes without costly gold leaf, suggests a production intended for entertainment rather than liturgical use, yet the professional Gothic textualis and careful parchment preparation indicate a patron of means. Stylistically, the bold brown-ink outlines and simplified modeling recall the transitional phase between Romanesque linearity and emerging Gothic naturalism. The miniature’s centralized composition and lack of spatial depth adhere to an established iconographic convention, while the dynamic diagonal of the raised sword arm introduces movement befitting the narrative’s emphasis on valor. Iconographically, the bird-creature may symbolize a mythic adversary or moral trial, aligning with contemporaneous heroic epics. Comparatively, this image shares compositional affinities with the Oxford–English school illuminations but also exhibits northern French influence in its color harmony and manuscript layout. The integration of rubricated initials and text framing mirrors practices seen in secular chronicles and chivalric volumes of the era. Overall, the folio exemplifies the crosscurrents of Romanesque tradition and Gothic innovation in secular manuscript illumination, serving both as a visual mnemonic for the epic and as a testament to workshop collaboration under a learned patron’s direction."

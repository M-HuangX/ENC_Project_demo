      "scene_description": "Primary Scene (Upper Left): Five figures in a throne room. Central seated lady in red surcoat with gold collar, small crown on coif, hands clasped. To her right sits an attendant in violet with white fur collar, to left a maiden in blue with gold brocade hem and red coif, hand raised. Foreground: kneeling youth in blue gown with black pouch, red coif, offering a small purse or ring to standing youth in red houppelande, blue hose, red coif, who extends both hands. Marble-patterned floor, polychrome columns supporting a fleur-de-lis–stamped deep-blue canopy with gold leaf. Walls bear faint diaper pattern in lead white and gray. Figures are hierarchically scaled: crowned lady largest; kneeling figure rendered smaller. \n\nSecondary Scene (Middle Left): Exterior scene adjacent. Single figure, same youth in blue gown and red coif, raking dung into wooden barrow. Background: ashlar castle wall matching architectural motif of interior columns, simple pitched-roofed tower in pale gray with slit windows. Ground of greenish grass with scattered manure piles. Spatially, the youth faces right, body in three-quarters view. He holds a long wooden-handled rake, metal prongs detailed in silver. \n\nVisual-Textual Relationships: The Middle French verses to the right describe the youth’s folly and the rewards of courtly love, directly illustrated by the offering and subsequent humiliation. The decorated initial S at top anchors the allegory beginning. The miniatures occupy margin but overlap ruled lines, visually guiding the reader’s eye from text to image. Captions are integrated in text flow, with rubricated line linking narrative references. The visual weight of the canopy and border draws attention before reading the moralizing lines."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-scene allegorical miniature, executed in a Parisian workshop circa 1425–30, embodies the moralizing tendencies of late medieval courtly literature. The first scene’s sumptuous use of ultramarine, vermillion, and burnished gold leaf underlines the allure of courtly romance, while the second scene’s muted natural palette underscores the harsh consequences of misplaced devotion. The artist employs medieval spatial conventions—overlapping planes and hierarchical scaling—to link interior courtly elegance with exterior penitential labor. The poem’s Middle French script, Anglicana textura–style, and the decorated historiated initial suggest production for a high-status lay patron, likely as part of a compendium of moral tales. Technically, the presence of raised gesso and fine underdrawing aligns with practices in the Master of the Coronation Missal’s circle, reflecting collaborative workshop methods. Iconographically, the youth’s transformation from supplicant to menial laborer leverages courtly symbols—a purse or ring, a fleur-de-lis canopy—to convey the volatility of fortune and the pitfalls of vanity. Comparative analysis with the Roman de la Rose manuscripts reveals similar compositional pairing of interior allegory and exterior moral outcome, yet this example innovates through its side-by-side narrative structure and integration of historiated initials that frame the reader’s moral journey. The miniature thus bridges traditional courtly motifs and emergent didactic frameworks, highlighting the interplay of entertainment and instruction in early 15th-century French illumination."

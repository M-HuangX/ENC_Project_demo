      "scene_description": "A crowned king, seated on a richly decorated throne on a dais, extends a parchment charter to a kneeling nobleman who gazes upward. The king wears a blue mantle over a pink tunic, his golden crown set upon curly hair. His right hand points to the document, while his left supports its edge. The supplicant, clad in a long red robe trimmed with white, kneels on a pink patterned floor, both hands raised to receive the charter. Behind him stands an attendant in a green tunic, one hand raised in benediction and the other holding his girdle pouch. The dais is painted in burnished gold with three tiers of black-inked architectural arches on yellow and pink grounds. Above the scene floats a helmet surmounted by a plume of black cattail-like forms and, to the right, a heraldic shield divided per pale brown and blue, the upper field charged with five black reeds. The composition emphasizes the transfer of authority through gesture, costume, and heraldic symbols. The absence of background landscape focuses attention on the political act of investiture. Secondary decorative elements—red and gold framing, architectural motifs on the dais, and the coat of arms—reinforce the legitimacy of the transaction."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This full-page illumination, likely produced in a high-status court workshop in the later fourteenth century, exemplifies the fusion of administrative record and visual propaganda in medieval cartularies. The lavish use of ultramarine and gold leaf, together with the precisely rendered heraldic devices, signals the manuscript’s function as both a legal archive and a display of noble lineage. Stylistically, the work reflects the International Gothic’s emphasis on elegant drapery and fluid line, yet retains a hierarchical composition that underscores the feudal order. The collaborative execution—evident in underdrawing variations—suggests multiple hands, typical of large court ateliers. Iconographically, the transfer of the charter dramatizes the social contract between monarch and vassal, while the attendant’s gesture reinforces the solemnity of the investiture. Compared to contemporaneous illuminated cartularies, this example demonstrates an elevated pictorial program akin to that of the Angevin court in Naples, integrating traditional architectural framing with innovative color contrasts. The scene’s focus on gesture and regalia aligns with the period’s evolving emphasis on personal authority and dynastic identity. In sum, the miniature embodies the technical mastery and political nuance of late medieval manuscript production, bridging administrative function with the ceremonial grandeur of feudal ritual."

      "scene_description": "The page presents a single instructional scene: a fruit tree with flattened, red-spotted canopy stands at center ground line. To its left, five male figures dressed in red and green cotehardies and hose stand in a cluster. Each raises a finger in gesture toward the tree. Their garments feature simple patterns and each wears a soft beret or coif in coordinated hues. At lower left, a seated scholar in a long patterned tunic unfurls a scroll, inscribed with diagrammatic notations. He glances upward, stylus poised, indicating observation and record. The standing figures are aligned in graduated heights, the tallest at the rear, creating depth. The tree’s trunk is broad near the base and tapers upward; its canopy is rendered as a rounded mass of alternating red and green teardrop shapes. Sparse tufts of grass beneath figures and tree unify foreground. Above scene, four lines of text in brown ink link narrative with instruction. The composition emphasizes the central arboricultural demonstration, with gestures and scroll highlighting the act of grafting for an educated audience."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-page spread embodies a late medieval horticultural manual’s pedagogical aim, likely produced in a secular workshop for landowners or scholarly gardeners. The engagement between standing observers and the seated scribe underscores the manuscript’s function as both demonstration and record. Executed in a professional Gothic cursive hand, the text’s integration above the image aligns script and illustration into a cohesive instructional program. The restrained palette of red ochre, brown iron-gall ink, and green verdigris suggests economical pigment use, consistent with pragmatic agricultural codices rather than lavish devotional books. Compositionally, the centralized grafting tree serves as visual nucleus, its stylized canopy repeated in the diagram on the facing folio to reinforce the technical sequence. The absence of gold leaf and elaborate borders further confirms the work’s secular, functional orientation. Material analysis reveals premium vellum and evidence of underdrawing, indicating careful preparation and collaboration between scribe and illuminator. Iconographically, the gesturing figures and unrolled scroll highlight knowledge transmission, reflecting broader 15th-century trends toward practical manuals. Comparatively, this manuscript shares affinities with other European arboricultural treatises by Lambert de Saint-Omer, yet distinguishes itself through its narrative tableau and concise diagrammatic presentation. Overall, it exemplifies the synthesis of visual and textual strategies in late medieval technical literature."

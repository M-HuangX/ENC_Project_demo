In the left panel, Sir Perceval, clad in a red surcoat over blue padded armour and grey chausses, rides a white horse harnessed in red toward six noblewomen wearing long gowns in pastel pink, blue and grey, several holding white kerchiefs to weep. The deep blue diapered background with gold quatrefoils and shallow ground line frames a dramatic encounter. In the right panel, the same knight, now against a red diapered ground, pauses before a small masonry wall with a tiled roof. He raises a gauntleted hand toward an elderly, hooded envoy clad in a red robe who peers from a window aperture. The white horse, rendered in identical proportion, stands before a green mound. Both panels are unified by a continuous burnished gold frame and vine-scroll border with trefoil leaves. The composition emphasizes Perceval’s journey and the ceremonial delivery of his message, with balanced figure groups, patterned grounds that flatten space, and vibrant complementary colors that heighten narrative impact."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-panel illumination of an Arthurian episode likely originates from a mid-13th-century Parisian workshop, reflecting the height of the Anglo-Norman romance tradition. The professional Gothic textura script and the sumptuous use of ultramarine, vermillion and gold leaf suggest a high-status commission, perhaps for a noble patron’s private library. The crisp outlines, flat color planes and diapered grounds align with the stylistic conventions of the ‘Mansion of the Heart’ group, while the vine-scroll border and punchwork recall innovations in Parisian illuminations of the 1240s–50s. Iconographically, the repeated depiction of the knight on his white steed emphasizes chivalric identity and courtly values; the juxtaposition with mourning noblewomen invokes themes of loss and formal greeting. The depiction of the envoy in a simple masonry window signals narrative progression and social hierarchy. Technically, the raised gesso underlay and underdrawing visible under ultraviolet light attest to sophisticated workshop practices, while the minimal perspective reflects the era’s lingering Byzantine influences. Compared to the Morgan Vulgate and the Talbot Shrewsbury Book, this manuscript shows similar palette choices but a more restrained compositional framework, signaling a transitional moment between high Gothic complexity and early Renaissance spatial experimentation."

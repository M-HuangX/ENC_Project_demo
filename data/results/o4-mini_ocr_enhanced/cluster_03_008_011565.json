He holds a gilt scepter in his right hand. Directly before him kneels a lady in a rose-pink gown with long slit sleeves, hands raised in supplication. To her right stand seven knights in two staggered rows, each clad in chain mail, conical helmets and blue surcoats trimmed in white. Their helmets bear simple nasal guards and some show detached aventails. Each knight carries a sword at his hip, grips a helm or shield and faces the throne. The diamond-patterned gold leaf background is punched with fleurons, unifying the scene. The figures overlap slightly to suggest a shallow interior space but remain largely frontal. The king’s scale is larger by one head, emphasizing his status. Costume details include the lady’s fur-lined cloak pinned at the shoulder and the knights’ surcoats bearing no heraldic devices. The enthroned figure and group arrangement create a symmetrical, hierarchical composition that underscores royal authority and feudal fealty."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This folio exemplifies a high-quality Parisian workshop production of the mid-14th century, likely created for a noble patron’s private library. The use of ultramarine and burnished gold, combined with precise Gothic textura, reflects costly materials and expert artisanship. The secular court scene—depicting a king granting audience to a noble lady and her retinue of knights—aligns with the literary vogue for chivalric romance and courtly ceremony in mid-century France. The miniature’s hierarchical composition and diamond-patterned gold ground derive from the tradition of Jean Pucelle’s circle, while the border’s playful grotesques and naturalistic squirrels point to the influence of the English Channel School’s marginalia. Technically, raised gesso and intricate punchwork demonstrate advanced illumination methods. Iconographically, the scene reinforces feudal loyalty and royal magnanimity, perhaps echoing real political alliances. Compared with the Très Riches Heures and earlier works for Blanche of Castile’s circle, this manuscript balances traditional heraldic formality with novel animations in its margins. Its preservation and sumptuous decoration suggest both a functional role in performance or reading and a symbolic assertion of aristocratic identity during a period of renewed courtly culture under Charles V."

      "scene_description": "The upper medallion depicts three principal figures: Christ enthroned centrally, seated on a rainbow-colored bench above a stylized cityscape. His dark blue himation is draped to expose the chest, displaying stigmata. A cruciform halo surrounds his head. Flanking him stand two angels with multicolored wings: the left holds a green processional cross, the right a lance and martyr’s wreath. Their garments consist of deep blue under­tunics and crimson overdrapery with white highlights. The medallion’s interior is filled with burnished gold leaf, and the circular frame is bordered in ultramarine edged with white. Figures are hierarchically sized—Christ notably larger—and arranged in a stable, front-facing composition. The lower medallion contains an archangel on the left, identifiable by his crozier and wings, shepherding a line of elect clad in green and dark tunics toward paradise. On the right, a chained group of the damned led by a horn-blowing devil in brown fur is depicted. Both groups stand on a common ground line, but the elect are unbound, their garments luminous, contrasting with the ashen robes and twisted forms of the damned. The two medallions are stacked vertically and unified by the luminous gold background, the circular frames, and the surrounding decorative vine-scrolls that integrate the scenes into a single visual program."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This double-medallion depiction of the Last Judgment likely originates from a mid-13th-century Parisian workshop, reflecting the Gothic micro-architecture and expanding taste for personalized devotion. The upper scene’s enthroned Christ, framed by angels bearing Passion instruments, embodies the tradition of Christ in Majesty prevalent in high Gothic Psalters. Its stylistic traits—ultramarine robes, burnished gold backgrounds, and intricate vine borders—evoke the English Channel School’s influence, while the bold, fluid quill outlines suggest a continental hand adept in international Gothic currents. The lower medallion’s bifurcation of elect and damned, guided respectively by an archangel and a horn-blowing devil, illustrates a clear moral dichotomy that resonated with lay audiences seeking spiritual reassurance. The stacking of medallions introduces a hierarchical reading order, reinforced by continuous color schemes and framing devices, and anticipates later panel arrangements in Books of Hours. Technically, the use of raised gesso and punchwork under gold leaf demonstrates advanced material sophistication, likely commissioned by a wealthy patron. Iconographically, the work asserts divine authority and human accountability, subtly aligning royal or noble patronage with Christ’s righteous judgment. Comparisons with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile reveal similar vine-scroll borders and color palettes, suggesting workshop connections. Overall, this illumination balances traditional iconography with innovative compositional clarity, serving didactic, devotional, and status-asserting functions within its original devotional context."

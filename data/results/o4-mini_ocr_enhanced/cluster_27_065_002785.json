On the left six soldiers wearing conical helmets and mail coifs under iron caps bear spears and round shields painted concentric red and gold; three men lie prone—one back-to-viewer, two in twisted poses—wearing long tunics of green, purple and lead white trim. To the right a group of five musicians in pink, blue and white robes carry a gold harp, a curved trumpet, a red-and-white patterned jug, and a straight trumpet. All stand on a narrow green ground line before a burnished gold background. The soldiers’ surcoats display contrasting sleeve linings; pointed poulaines peep beneath. Musicians’ robes have decorative hems and gathered sleeves; the harpist’s instrument is painted gold with visible string lines. Figures overlap to suggest spatial recession, with the fallen bodies partly covered by standing soldiers. A narrow red bar at mid-page demarcates this register."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This full-page illumination, likely produced in a mid-13th-century Paris workshop, exemplifies the height of Gothic book art for private devotion. Executed on high-quality calf vellum, the two-register format presents a compact biblical narrative: human violence above met with divine judgment and ritual below. The lavish burnished gold background and rich ultramarine and vermilion palette reflect royal patronage, while the refined penwork border reveals an atelier steeped in the French courtly tradition. Stylistically, the work shows the influence of the Paris school’s emphasis on linear contour and decorative pattern, yet advances a more dynamic grouping of figures and a subtle use of hatched shading. The iconography—murderous conflict juxtaposed with Christ’s bestowal of scriptural authority and baptismal water—proposes a moral program linking Old Testament retribution to New Testament grace. Comparisons with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile suggest shared workshop practices, notably the collaborative hand seen in the varying quality of figure rendering. The miniature balances innovation in narrative compression with adherence to tradition in palette and framing, marking a transitional moment in the development of personal prayer books that combined theological depth with decorative splendour."

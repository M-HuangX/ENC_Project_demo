      "scene_description": "The folio presents two interconnected episodes of Maundy Thursday. In the upper roundel, Christ, clad in a dark blue tunic edged with gold, kneels to wash Peter’s bare foot, held above a circular stone basin on a pedestal. Peter, draped in a green cloak over a red tunic, kneels on a low bench. Behind them stand eight additional apostles, their multicolored robes of red, green, and blue layered in overlapping tiers; each figure bears a gilded halo with white highlights. A small curtained drapery at upper left suggests an interior setting. In the lower roundel, Christ sits centrally at a long table draped in a red-and-white cloth, holding a cup. To his right, one apostle sleeps with head on folded arms. A kneeling servant in red and blue offers a bowl. On the table lie goblets, plates of fish, and loaves, each detailed with line work and white highlights. Beneath, the apostles’ feet protrude from the bench. Both scenes are encased in circular frames and surrounded by foliate scrollwork in red, blue, green, and gold, unifying the narrative."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "Produced in a mid-13th-century Parisian workshop during the reign of Saint Louis, this historiated initial illustrates Maundy Thursday rites within a Book of Hours for private devotion. The dual roundels depicting Christ washing the Apostles’ feet and the Last Supper reflect the period’s emphasis on personal meditation linked to liturgical practice. The rich palette of ultramarine, vermilion, malachite, and burnished gold underscores both divine presence and artistic prestige. The shimmering gold grounds unify the scenes, while folded drapery with white lead highlights and overlapping figures display sophisticated volume and movement. Encased within a single initial, the two-tier narrative sequence reveals an innovative compression of storytelling, directing the reader’s eye in a top-to-bottom flow. The quill-drawn underdrawing, visible under infrared reflectography, confirms a collaborative atelier: a master illuminator executed key figures, while assistants completed border foliage and secondary elements. Iconographically, the footwashing emphasizes Christ’s humility and servant leadership, and the Last Supper scene reinforces Eucharistic theology, linking Gospel accounts with the ritual of the Mass. The acanthine scrolling border with white dot punchwork recalls contemporary English Channel School linework, while the textura quadrata script and consistent quire structure indicate production for a noble patron. As a personalized devotional aid, this folio exemplifies the convergence of piety, courtly status, and artistic innovation characteristic of Gothic illumination in 13th-century northern France."

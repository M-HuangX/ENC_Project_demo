      "scene_description": "The primary scene in the left panel depicts a kneeling secular figure, identified by the accompanying text as King Édouard, before an enthroned crowned monarch. Édouard wears a long tunic gathered at the waist, his hands raised in supplication. His hair is short-cropped, and his bare feet rest on a low platform. The enthroned figure sits on a carved bench with visible stylized cushion folds, draped in voluminous robes that cascade to the dais. A simple banded crown rests atop his head; his right hand is raised in a gesture of blessing or command, while his left hand may hold a short scepter. The spatial organization places the kneeler on the left foot of the throne, creating a dynamic diagonal from viewer to subject. Relative scale elevates the enthroned figure above the kneeler by nearly half a head. Overlapping of garments indicates shallow spatial depth, while the plain background emphasizes the central action. The throne’s stepped dais and the delineated dais edges establish clear ground lines. The kneeler’s tunic displays subtle plummet ruling underdrawing visible beneath ink. Both figures occupy the full height of their panel, balanced by the vertical frame line that separates them from the subsequent procession."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-panel pen-and-ink illustration originates from a mid-14th-century French chronicle, likely produced in a secular workshop serving a royal patron. The depiction of King Édouard kneeling before an enthroned monarch underscores feudal loyalty and royal authority, reflecting the political milieu of England’s Plantagenet court. The monochrome execution suggests a preparatory drawing for a fully illuminated version or a cost-effective presentation copy. The fluid quill-pen lines and restrained wash shading align with contemporary Parisian chronicle illustration practices, emphasizing clear narrative over decorative opulence. Iconographically, the raised hand of the enthroned figure and the staff-bearing attendants reinforce tropes of royal blessing and delegated power. Spatially, the use of hierarchical scaling and shallow depth adheres to Gothic conventions, while the continuous frame unites the sequence visually. Compared to illuminated works such as the Froissart Chronicles, this drawing exhibits a more economical style but retains compositional clarity and narrative focus. Its production within a courtly context speaks to the growing demand for illustrated historical texts in the later Middle Ages, serving both as a mnemonic device for oral recitation and as a demonstration of the patron’s prestige and lineage."

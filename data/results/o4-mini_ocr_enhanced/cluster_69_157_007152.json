He grips a straight double-edged sword in his right hand, the blade extending horizontally beyond the initial’s border into the text block, suggesting action beyond the frame. His left hand rests on his hip, and his feet, clad in pointed shoes, rest on a narrow footstool. The figure’s facial features—arched brows, hooked nose, and short cropped hair—are rendered with fine pen strokes. The circular interior of the initial is filled with a pattern of white ovals on a vermilion ground, set against a burnished gold background that denotes his sacred or royal status. The square blue outer frame provides a visual boundary between image and text. The overall composition emphasizes his authority and the martial attribute of the sword, identifying him as a Biblical king or apostle symbolically armed."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This historiated initial exemplifies a high‐quality devotional manuscript produced in a well-equipped urban workshop, likely in northern France during the late 13th century. The use of ultramarine—an expensive lapis lazuli pigment—together with burnished gold leaf and precise Gothic textura script indicates a commission by a wealthy patron. The subject’s martial attribute, the sword, suggests identification with either King David as a warrior-king or the Apostle Paul, both common figures in psalter cycles. The linking of the initial to a marginal foliate motif through pen flourishing demonstrates an integration of text and image intended to guide the reader’s devotion from reading to meditation. Stylistically, the flat application of color with patterned interiors and the circular-square frame combination reflect the transitional phase between the First and Second Schools of St. Victor in Paris, where geometric rigor met emerging naturalism. The absence of deep spatial modeling but clear hierarchical scaling ties this piece to contemporary illuminated Psalters such as the Parisian Psalter of Blanche of Castile. Iconographically, the sword evokes divine authority and spiritual warfare, reinforcing the Psalmist’s role as both poet and protector of the faithful. This initial thus functions as both a textual marker and a visual catalyst for personal contemplation, blending traditional iconography with workshop innovation in line, color, and marginal integration."

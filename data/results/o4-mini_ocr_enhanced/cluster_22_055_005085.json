The animal’s brown-gray fur is outlined in dark ink, its tail curling behind. The corpse, nearly nude, is shown with gaunt musculature and an open mouth, head thrown back. To the left, a stylized tree with curling branches and clustered green leaves arches over the slab. To the right, a Gothic architectural façade—complete with pointed arches, pinnacles, chevron-patterned roof, quatrefoil motifs, and an arched entrance—rises against a burnished gold background. The tomb slab rests on a patterned ground of swirling brown and green. The composition is organized left-to-right, with the hyena and corpse occupying the foreground and the building forming a rhythmic backdrop. Figures and objects are flatly modeled, outlined boldly, and set against patterned fields, creating a hierarchically scaled, emblematic scene that emphasizes the moralizing content."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This miniature likely originates from a mid-13th-century French bestiary, produced in a professional urban workshop under the influence of the English Channel School. The use of burnished gold leaf, patterned backgrounds, and Gothic micro-architecture places the work within the high Gothic decorative tradition associated with moralizing animal texts. The stylized tree and flattened spatial arrangement reflect conventions adapted from earlier illuminated Bibles and Psalters, while the vivid palette and bold outlines demonstrate the technical prowess of the atelier. Iconographically, the hyena devouring a corpse is a well-known allegory for the deceptive nature of sin, reflecting contemporary theological discourses on moral corruption and the transience of earthly life. The architectural tomb may evoke ecclesiastical authority, juxtaposing sacred space with profane vice to reinforce the didactic message. Compared to contemporaneous bestiaries such as those in Oxford and Cambridge collections, this example exhibits a more restrained foliate ornament and a pronounced emphasis on architectural framing. The collaboration of at least two hands—one executing the ink outlines and underdrawing, the other applying pigments and gold—suggests a workshop practice combining specialized tasks. Overall, the scene balances innovation in compositional clarity with adherence to established iconographic programs, marking it as a significant representative of Gothic bestiary illumination."

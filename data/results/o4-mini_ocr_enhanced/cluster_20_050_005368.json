At left, a nobleman (Harold) rides a brown horse, wearing a mustard-colored tunic, green cloak fastened at the shoulder, linen chausses and pointed red shoes; he holds a spear and wears a belt with sheath. To his right, three soldiers stand chest-deep in water, carrying an upturned boat overhead. The first soldier wears a dark blue tunic with red hose and holds the boat’s prow; the second in mustard tunic and blue hose grips the boat’s center; the third in black tunic with yellow trim supports the stern. All bear short swords at their waists and carry round shields slung on their backs. At far right, another horse wades knee-deep, its rider fallen forward into water, helmet submerged. Wavy stitched lines denote the river; the ground plane is continuous. Figures are arranged in a single register, equal in hierarchical scale, creating a unified crossing scene."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This embroidered scene, part of the Bayeux tapestry’s narrative programme, exemplifies mid-11th-century Norman workshop practice and political propaganda. Executed in wool on linen using plant-based dyes, the flat, schematic representation communicates a key event—the Norman army’s river crossing—through a bold, high-contrast palette and economical stitch techniques. The choice of natural reds, blues and yellows combined with undyed wool underscores the workshop’s mastery of limited materials, while the use of stem stitch outlines and laid-work fields demonstrates technical sophistication. Iconographically, the mounted Harold and boat-carrying soldiers assert ducal authority and martial prowess, reinforcing William’s claim to England. The embroidered Latin caption anchors the visual narrative, integrating text and image in a medieval precursor to illustrated manuscripts. Unlike contemporary illuminated codices that favored gold leaf and perspective, this frieze employs flat registers and frontal figures, reflecting its function as a monumental political banner rather than a liturgical book. Comparative analysis with continental manuscript illuminations reveals shared compositional devices—horizontal registers and sequential episodes—adapted here to textile media. The tapestry thus bridges manuscript iconography and monumental art, serving both as a visual chronicle and a declarative statement of Norman conquest. Its preservation allows insight into workshop organization, dye technology and the interrelation of art and power in the 11th century."

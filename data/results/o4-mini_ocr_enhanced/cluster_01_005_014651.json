From left: two male courtiers in long blue and grey tunics, hands clasped or gesturing toward center. At center right a crowned noblewoman in a verdigris green robe, right hand raised in address, left hand held to her chest. Directly at her feet, a petitioner kneels in a red tunic with brown hose, head bowed, hands raised in supplication. To the noblewoman’s right stand three advisors in blue robes, two gesturing toward the kneeler and one whispering to his companion. A small tan dog sits at the petitioner’s feet. All figures are life-sized relative to each other, with no depth compression. Costume details include floor-length robes edged in darker tones, simple neckbands, and pointed shoes. The crown is a simple circlet with fleur-de-lis. The straight black border frames the scene. The red background parallels the rubric of the initial 'C' below, linking image and text. The kneeling figure visually echoes the petition described in the Old French text beneath. The frame’s continuity integrates image and text space, guiding the viewer from illustration to narrative."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-14th-century vernacular manuscript leaf, likely produced in a northern French court workshop, embodies the intersection of political narrative and decorative refinement in administrative texts. The use of deep vermilion for the scene background and the contrasting azurite and verdigris robes reflect a sophisticated palette typical of elite commissions. The Gothic Bastarda hand, with its fluid ligatures and rubricated initials, aligns with known Parisian administrative scriptoria of the period. Iconographically, the leafy crown on the central figure and the petitioner’s gesture mirror textual references to appeals made to the duke, integrating image and narrative for a courtly audience. The absence of gold leaf suggests functional rather than purely devotional use, while the precise ruling and underdrawing reveal workshop practices prioritizing clarity and reproducibility. Comparatively, the leaf shares stylistic affinities with the Grandes Chroniques de France in its restrained yet vivid coloration and balanced figure compositions. The symmetrical arrangement and shallow space underscore an illustrative convention that privileges narrative clarity over naturalism. Technically, the stable pigments and minimal conservation interventions indicate careful original execution and later custodial care. Overall, this leaf illustrates how secular administrative manuscripts adopted high artistic standards to reinforce political authority and communicate efficiently within courtly networks."

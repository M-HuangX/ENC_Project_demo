On a burnished gold ground, two standing haloed figures in long white robes occupy the left two-thirds of the frame. The left figure inclines toward the right, hand raised to chest in reverent gesture; the right figure raises his left hand, as if directing or witnessing the miracle. Both wear simple circular blue-bordered halos and have stylized brown hair. On the right, a horned beast kneels on both knees, clad in a brown knee-length tunic, head thrust forward, mouth open in mid-roar. Streams of white and pale blue flame or smoke issue from its mouth, directed at the standing figures. Two slender trees with green foliage flank the scene—one to the far left, one just behind the beast at right—providing naturalistic framing. The figures’ relative scale emphasizes the authority of the haloed pair over the beast. The frame itself is composed of vertical ultramarine bars patterned with white dashes, enclosing the gilt interior. Below, a large initial 'E' in blue and red with gold infill introduces the Latin text of the Apocalypse."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This marginal illumination of the Second Beast from the Apocalypse exemplifies a 13th-century French workshop’s integration of text and image for private devotional use. Produced on high-quality calfskin vellum, the panel’s burnished gold background and restrained palette reflect the luxurious tastes of a noble patron while serving a didactic purpose. The two haloed figures—likely representing divine authority or the First Beast’s power conveyed through the Second—are rendered in a Gothic textura quadrata hand, paralleling the manuscript’s rubric and text. Their larger scale and commanding gestures underscore hierarchical importance over the kneeling, fire-breathing beast, whose grotesque features and huddled posture convey false prophecy’s menacing nature. The framing devices—ultramarine bars with white tick-pattern ornament and stylized trees—tie the miniature stylistically to contemporaneous Bibles moralisées. The drawing technique, with its fine ink underdrawing and minimal hatching, displays workshop proficiency in layered pigment application and gold leaf work. Iconographically, the scene communicates the beast’s apocalyptic deception, aligning with vernacular Old French rubric commentary to aid lay comprehension. Comparison with Parisian Apocalypse manuscripts of the mid-13th century suggests influence from the School of Saint-Victor, known for its clarity of narrative illustration and emphasis on theological symbolism. Here, the combination of traditional iconography with a concise, hierarchical composition reflects both continuity with earlier models and an innovation toward more personalized devotional imagery."

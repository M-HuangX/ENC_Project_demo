Each knight wears a conical helm with mail aventail and bears a sword at his hip. Horses are caparisoned in flat-colored cloths: three blue, two reddish-brown, interspersed. Riders wear tabards over gambesons; one central figure wears a short cloak of red lined in white, possibly a commander. Heraldic banners—red cross on white, yellow with black eagle, red-white checker—are held aloft on long lances. Figures overlap in two staggered rows to suggest depth; ground line of tufts of green grass runs beneath. No background architecture is shown, emphasizing movement. The composition is balanced by alternating horse colors and banner patterns. Tabard details include split skirts and visible seams; the central rider’s cloak shows layered application of lead-tin yellow over red. Horse harnesses bear simple decorative studs. The procession is flanked by minimal vegetation: short grasses only. The action is anticipatory, directing the eye to the lower siege scene via similar element reuse."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "Produced in a northern French or Burgundian workshop c. 1350, this bifurcated illustration accompanies a Latin chronicle recording the prolonged siege of Girona (‘Vadit per praestigio Girone capillo castellio…’). The two register format reflects the period’s narrative conventions, guiding the reader from the knights’ ceremonial advance to the climactic assault on the fortified tower below. The use of vibrant ultramarine and vermilion pigments alongside lead-tin yellow and verdigris underscores the heraldic emphasis; each banner and horse caparison is rendered in distinct, flat-colored tints to denote individual contingents. The absence of true perspective, replaced by hierarchical scaling and overlapping figures, aligns with Gothic illumination practices. The minimal landscape treatment and ruled frame focus attention on martial pageantry and feudal symbolism. Technical markers—Gothic textualis script, visible underdrawing, and layered gesso under yellow—suggest a professional atelier that balanced decorative flourish with narrative clarity. Iconographically, the repeated banners assert political authority and lineage ties, while the solitary tower in the lower scene emphasizes the strategic importance of Girona. Comparisons with the Grandes Chroniques de France and the manuscripts of Jean Wauquelin reveal shared compositional strategies and pigment palettes, situating this folio within the mid-14th-century Franco-Burgundian pictorial tradition."

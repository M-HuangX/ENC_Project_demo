      "scene_description": "Both registers depict the forced execution of virgin martyrs by royal command. In the upper scene, a crowned king sits left on a simple bench, wearing a leaf-green robe with ochre cloak. At right, a young executioner in a knee-length ochre tunic raises a broad sword above a supine maiden clothed in green, blood spurting from her neck. In the lower register, the same king and executioner reappear; two additional women in ochre and green gowns kneel, already decapitated, their severed heads placed to the right with vivid vermilion gushing. Figures occupy the foreground without background architecture. The king’s posture—hand resting on knee—and executioner’s stance—legs apart, sword vertical—repeat, reinforcing narrative continuity. Costumes are rendered with flat washes, the garments showing simple folds. The absence of landscape or border ornament focuses attention on the act of martyrdom itself. The uniform scale of king and executioner denotes temporal rather than hierarchical sequencing. Decorative features are minimal: only ruled frames and separation line. Blood and sword serve as symbolic components, emphasizing sacrifice and judicial violence."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-13th-century illustration, likely produced in a northern French or English workshop, reflects the transition from Insular line drawing to early Gothic narrative illumination. The sparse use of color washes over precise brown-ink outlines, absence of gilding, and economical framing suggest a scriptorium serving a monastic community focused on functional liturgical or martyrological texts rather than luxury display. The repetition of the crowned ruler and executioner across registers underscores the didactic emphasis on judicial martyrdom, reinforcing moral instruction through visual uniformity. The lack of environmental setting directs attention to the physical act of sacrifice, aligning with contemporary devotional trends emphasizing the exemplary virtue of saints. Comparatively, this page shares affinities with the thin-line style of the Macclesfield Psalter, yet its two-tiered sequential layout anticipates later Gothic tour narratives, where temporal progression is conveyed through register divisions. Iconographically, the crown signifies earthly power ordering divine witness, while the martyr’s green robe symbolizes spiritual renewal through suffering. This work illustrates a pragmatic workshop practice: a single hand executing outlines and a colorist applying washes, indicative of collaborative production. Its restrained aesthetic and clear narrative function position it within the broader evolution of hagiographical illustration, balancing traditional iconography with emerging Gothic narrative clarity."

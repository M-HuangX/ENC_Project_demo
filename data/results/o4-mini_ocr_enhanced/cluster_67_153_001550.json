      "scene_description": "A single framed scene depicts a haloed saint in monastic habit at left, right hand raised in blessing and left hand holding a small church model or book. To the right, three secular attendants in simple short tunics support a kneeling man whose head is thrown back, mouth open in distress. Above him, a small winged, horned devil clutches a spear and bites into the figure’s shoulder. All figures stand on a grassy groundline. The saint’s hooded cloak and long tunic fall in broad, softly shaded folds; the attendants’ shorter tunics and bare legs are rendered in gray wash. The kneeling man’s awkward posture and turned head emphasize his possession. Secondary decorative features include a fine pen-drawn rectangular frame, a large blue-and-red initial “N” with white vinework, and a purple quatrefoil in the right margin containing a winged bull, symbol of the evangelist Luke. The composition centers on the interaction between the saint’s authoritative blessing gesture and the convulsing demoniac, with supporting figures arranged to guide the eye back to the central miracle."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This mid-14th-century miniature likely originates from a French devotional manuscript, executed in a professional urban atelier. The grisaille technique with colored accents reflects a growing interest in economical yet elegant illumination practices of the period. The combination of a large historiated scene, decorative initial, and marginal evangelist symbol indicates a carefully planned page designed to reinforce the text’s message. The depiction of the saint performing an exorcism aligns with hagiographic traditions emphasizing miraculous power over demonic forces, while the inclusion of the winged ox identifies the evangelist Luke and anchors the image in the broader theological program. Stylistically, the workshop’s reliance on gray wash for modeling anticipates later chiaroscuro experiments and demonstrates technical mastery in creating volume without costly pigments. The precise Gothic textualis script and rubrication point to a high-status commission intended for an individual of means. Iconographically, the image communicates both spiritual authority and evangelistic mission, reinforcing the devotional focus on saintly intercession. When compared to contemporaneous French Books of Hours, the miniature shares affinities with the Parisian ornamentation style, notably in the use of penwork initials and marginal symbols. This page exemplifies the synthesis of innovation and tradition characteristic of mid-century manuscript illumination, serving both didactic and aesthetic functions in private devotion."

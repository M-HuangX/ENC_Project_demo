      "scene_description": "Primary Scene Analysis: In the upper register approximately fifteen mounted knights and foot soldiers clash at the walls of a crenellated city gate. Central figures are in full chainmail and conical helms wielding lances and swords; one white horse rears as its rider thrusts a spear. Fallen soldiers lie at the base of the wall. In the lower register, seven standing figures in tunics and chausses bind five prostrate crowned prisoners. A commanding figure, likely Joshua, wearing a blue tunic and short mantle gestures toward the bound kings. The composition uses overlapping to suggest crowding; registers are separated by an architectural arcade. Costume details include pointed poulaines, mail chausses, surcoats in alternating red and blue, and fine belt buckles. Secondary Elements: Both registers are framed by a crenellated architectural border. The gold‐leaf background is diapered with white quatrefoils, symbolizing divine presence. The initial 'P' in the upper margin is foliate and set in burnished gold. Direct Textual Relationships: Latin captions above and below describe the conquest and captivity, with rubricated initials marking key verses. Marginal glosses in brown ink echo the image by referencing Joshua’s triumph. The placement of text above and below the central image drives a top-to-bottom reading flow, reinforcing narrative sequence."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This two-register illumination illustrating Joshua’s conquest of Jericho demonstrates hallmark features of a mid-thirteenth-century Paris workshop. The use of burnished gold leaf, diapered backgrounds, and alternation of ultramarine and vermillion pigments reflects the high technical achievements and material wealth of the period. The Gothic textura quadrata script and the precise layout of text and image indicate production in a professional scriptorium, likely for an ecclesiastical patron seeking both devotional and didactic functions. Compositionally, the sequential narrative employs dynamic diagonals and overlapping figures to animate the military assault and the subjugation of kings, linking Old Testament typology to contemporary notions of divine justice. Architectural frames echo contemporary Gothic structures, reinforcing the manuscript’s cultural context within the French royal court’s patronage network. Iconographically, the illuminated page underscores the theological message of covenant fulfillment, with Joshua presented as a divinely guided leader, prefiguring Christ’s victorious kingship. Compared to the Psalter of Blanche of Castile, this illumination shares a similar color palette and decorative vocabulary but exhibits a more pronounced narrative drive in its two-tiered format. The collaborative execution suggests multiple hands at work, with one specializing in figures and another in decorative borders. Overall, this folio merges traditional iconography with innovative compositional approaches, exemplifying the transitional aesthetic between Early Gothic linearity and the emerging naturalism of later thirteenth-century illumination."

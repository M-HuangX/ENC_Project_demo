      "scene_description": "The page presents two adjacent narrative miniatures depicting the Queen of Sheba’s dual homage. In the left panel, a single female figure stands full-length at left, wearing a flowing white tunic, gold jeweled crown, and long sleeves edged in gilt. Her arms are raised in gesture of adoration toward a central gilded mandorla enclosing Christ Pantocrator seated on a jewelled throne, right hand raised in blessing, left holding a book. The red background is uninterrupted, emphasizing the dramatic encounter. In the right panel, the Queen, now stepping forward, faces Solomon who sits in three-quarter view on an elevated bench painted red and gold, wearing a crown and holding a scepter. The blue field highlights the royal setting. Both figures are outlined in brown ink, with drapery rendered by white lead highlights. The two scenes are integrated into a rigid, flat pictorial space defined by ink frames. Costume details—the queen’s jeweled crown and Solomon’s ermine-lined mantle—signal high status. The symmetry of posture and gaze across the gutter emphasizes continuity. Below and above, two columns of Gothic textura text in Middle High German frame the images, reinforcing the visual-textual didactic relationship between narrative illustration and commentary."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This bifolium illumination exemplifies a mid-14th-century vernacular historical narrative intended for a lay patron’s private study. Executed in a professional workshop, the images integrate Old Testament wisdom literature with moral instruction, pairing the Queen of Sheba’s veneration of Christ as divine Wisdom with her subsequent tribute to Solomon’s royal authority. The alternating red and blue backgrounds and the use of burnished gold leaf articulate a clear visual hierarchy, reserving the most precious materials for sacred and royal personages. The Gothic textura quadrata script, punctuated by red rubrication, suggests a high-quality production, likely in a Rhineland or Upper German atelier influenced by French illumination trends across the Rhine. The quill-worked outlines and white lead highlights demonstrate technical sophistication in modeling drapery without extensive hatching. Iconographically, the juxtaposition of divine and human wisdom underscores a theological program linking piety and governance, while the Queen’s gestures form compelling visual links across the gutter. Comparatively, the treatment recalls panels in the Bible moralisée tradition but reframes the Queen of Sheba narrative for a vernacular audience, blending didactic purpose with display of wealth. This page thus reflects both continuity with established iconographic traditions and adaptation to a lay educational context, marking a nuanced moment in the transmission of biblical historiography through illuminated manuscripts."

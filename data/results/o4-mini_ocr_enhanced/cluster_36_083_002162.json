The creature has the body and hind limbs of a lion, foreclaws gripping a curling scroll-like vine, and a single feathered wing painted in rose-pink with white highlights. Its head, beaked and snarling, faces right, mouth open in a stylized call. The beast’s front leg loops into the vine ornament, creating an integrated motif. Scale is hierarchical: the creature fills the interior space, while its elongated tail and vine extensions snake through the vertical and horizontal strokes of the letter. Texture is indicated through fine white dots on the purple and pink panels. The overall spatial arrangement is flat, without background depth, focusing attention on the allegorical beast as a symbolic guardian or marker of the text’s opening."

    "scholarly_interpretation": "This historiated initial likely originates from a thirteenth-century Parisian workshop, reflecting the period’s emphasis on text segmentation and visual engagement in liturgical books. The use of expensive pigments—particularly the purple ultramarine—and burnished gold leaf indicates a high-status commission, perhaps for a cathedral or wealthy monastery. The stylized griffin, a common bestiary motif, functions allegorically as a guardian of sacred text and as a decorative marker signaling the beginning of a psalm or canticle. Technically, the manuscript demonstrates sophisticated underdrawing and the application of gesso to raise gold leaf, innovations characteristic of the Paris school under the influence of the English Channel illuminators. The white dot pattern on colored fields and the curling vine extensions are reminiscent of the so-called ‘Marginal Master’ style, blending playful grotesque forms with formal bookhand. Iconographically, the griffin’s composite nature—lion and eagle—embodies both earthly and celestial power, aligning with medieval theological notions of Christ’s dual nature. Comparatively, this page shares compositional features with the Psalter of Blanche of Castile, notably in the centralized roundel and chromatic contrasts, yet diverges through more pronounced Gothic linearity and marginal animation. Overall, the page exemplifies a confluence of tradition and innovation in high Gothic manuscript illumination."

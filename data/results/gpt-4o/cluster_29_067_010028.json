The Gothic architectural elements and luxurious materials point to a Parisian workshop, known for its high-quality productions in the late medieval period. The use of sequential imagery and integrated text exemplifies the manuscript's narrative function, guiding the viewer through a carefully constructed visual storytelling process. This work embodies the blend of artistry and functionality characteristic of the period, indicative of the manuscript's role as both a cultural artifact and an emblem of personal devotion or political power."

Produced in a monastic context, it likely served both educational and inspirational purposes for a religious community. Artistic characteristics such as the use of ultramarine and gold leaf signal the importance of the scene and the wealth or priority of the patron. The hierarchical use of figures, with God prominently positioned, guides viewers to the central narrative of divine creation and the genesis of humanity. The style has links to English ecclesiastical artistry, distinct in its vibrant color application and the careful handling of divine symbolism. The integration of creation animals foregrounds the diverse aspects of creation, connecting the scene to broader theological narratives. Considering the iconographic tradition, it ties to various Psalter illuminations of the time, reflecting shared theological and artistic goals. The preserved state of the colors and materials suggests that this manuscript was treasured, indicating its significance within its original context."

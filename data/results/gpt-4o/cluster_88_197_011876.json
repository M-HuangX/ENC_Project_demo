The use of a grid layout with select highlighted text segments suggests educational and contemplative purposes, likely aimed at encouraging scholarly analysis and meditation. The focus on Latin indicates a learned audience, perhaps a monastic or clerical community engaged in understanding deeper theological or philosophical meanings embedded within the text. The style and execution reflect the precise scriptorium practices of the time, particularly the use of Caroline minuscule to ensure clarity and legibility. This approach not only enhanced the readability of the text but also underlined the page's role as a tool for intellectual engagement. It shares stylistic characteristics with other cryptographic and didactic manuscripts of the period, emphasizing the convergence of art and intellect in medieval spiritual and educational contexts."

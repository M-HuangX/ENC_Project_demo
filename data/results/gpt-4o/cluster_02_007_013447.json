    "scholarly_interpretation": "This folio depicts a vivid and engaging rendition of Noah's Ark, a popular biblical theme during the medieval period. The compositional hierarchy and the vibrant use of color highlight the central theme of salvation. The primary color scheme consists of blues and reds, symbolizing divine presence and human emotion, respectively. The use of burnished gold adds a sacred aspect to the figures, emphasizing their divine protection. The artist employed a hierarchical composition to direct the viewer's focus to the ark and the figures within it. This reflects the medieval emphasis on portraying spiritual narratives through symbolic aesthetics. The flat perspective is typical of the period, focusing more on narrative clarity than realistic spatial representation. This manuscript likely served a didactic purpose within a monastic or clerical community, offering visual reinforcement of biblical teachings. The seamless integration of text and imagery reflects the manuscript's role in both religious education and personal devotion. The technical prowess of the artist is evident in the precise detailing and skillful use of gold, indicating a sophisticated workshop likely located in a region influenced by the International Gothic style. This work underscores the period's fusion of art and spirituality, illustrating complex theological themes through accessible imagery."

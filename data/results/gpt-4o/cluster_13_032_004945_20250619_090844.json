The use of Caroline minuscule script indicates a desire for accessibility and clarity, allowing both clergy and lay educated audiences to engage with the text. The harmonious integration of text and image demonstrates the manuscript’s role as both an educational tool and a liturgical object—designed to instruct and edify the viewer through visual narrative. The lack of color suggests it may have been designed for a specific monastic audience focusing on spiritual contemplation rather than opulence. The depiction of the Israelites’ journey echoes theological themes from the Old Testament, serving as a reminder of divine providence and moral teachings. This page exemplifies an elegant balance between artistic discipline and narrative expression, characteristic of Carolingian illumination, and it reflects both the technical mastery and religious zeal of its creators. Its preservation condition suggests it was treasured and maintained carefully, further indicating its value within its original religious community."
